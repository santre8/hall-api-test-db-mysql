    "abstract_s":"This symposium focuses on the circulation of security governance models in cities of Southern Africa (Johannesburg, Cape Town, Windhoek and Maputo). It consists of three articles analysing at different scales (regional, national and intra-urban) the circulation of specific neighbourhood-based solutions to security issues, such as road closures, gated residential developments and business improvement districts. This spreading process, with the South African case at its core, is analysed within the theoretical framework of neoliberalism. The symposium, via this discussion of security models and the way they reflect the changing relationships between state and private actors locally, discusses the relevance of this framework to a fuller understanding of the transformation of Southern African cities.",

    "abstract_s":"Are we witnessing the decline of state involvement in education or is it being reshaped, and if so how? Surprisingly, this question has received little attention from researchers in education studies, sociology and political science. This book aims to fill this gap by exploring school evaluation policies in four European countries: England, France, Scotland and Switzerland. It shows that the same policy tool - promoted in many European and international arenas concerned with good practice in educational governance - can actually give rise in each system to a variety of policy configurations in which forms of state control can differ. Written from a policy sociology perspective, the book aims to go beyond the decline\/permanence dichotomy and proposes a specific conceptual framework within which to consider both contextualised forms of state intervention and their potential similarities and combinations. By doing this, the authors not only aim to counterbalance or supplement dominant views on the Europeanisation and transnationalisation of education policies but also to imagine new possibilities for state policy analysis.",

    "abstract_s":"We investigate the relationship between Corporate Social Performance (CSP) and country-level institutions for a sample of Western European firms from 13 countries over the period 2003 to 2010. We consider five different institutional factors and distinguish two categories of measures: country’s quality of legal institutions and laws protecting shareholder rights. Our results show that firms from countries with better institutional environment are more likely to engage in CSR activities, supporting both the prominent role of institutional environment in explaining CSP variation across firms and the CSR-value enhancing view. Moreover, both country’s quality of legal institutions and laws protecting shareholders rights explain scores on four domains: Environment, Corporate Governance, Human Resources and Human Rights. However, Business Behavior domain is only related to an indicator measuring laws protecting shareholders rights. Community Involvement is related to the quality of legal institutions in the country. Finally, we show that CSP is negatively affected by leverage and positively affected by firm size. However, CSP is not related to firm profitability.",

    "abstract_s":"Despite the growing public concern in recent years about the place of women in business, gender diversity in corporate governance has made little progress. As a consequence, the issue has captured the attention of policymakers throughout the world.Several countries are currently adopting or considering the adoption of laws or regulations to promote gender diversity on corporate boards. The purpose of this paper is to compare the effectiveness of using legislative or regulatory means to increase female representation instead of allowing firms to voluntarily fix their own non legally binding targets. We find that the relation between gender diversity and performance is positive in countries using the voluntary approach while it is negative in countries using the regulatory approach. We conclude that public policy aimed at increasing the number of women on corporate boards should be introduced gradually and voluntarily rather than quickly and coercively to avoid sub-optimal board composition.",

    "abstract_s":"The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of gender diversity on the boardroom and on top management positions on earnings management by French-listed firms. Based on a sample of 170 firms over 4 years, we find that the proportion of women on the board standing as a director or a chair reduces earnings management. This finding suggests that women are effective on their monitoring role and are then considered as a crucial corporate governance device. We also find that the relationship between the presence of at least three women on the board and earnings management is negative suggesting that by increasing the number of women on board through regulation and legislation, French firms are likely to enhance the effectiveness of the board to better detect earnings management. However, Women standing in CEO and CFO positions do not affect earnings management practices. These findings suggest that efforts made by political bodies to promote equality between men and women on boards are beneficial for French-listed companies by limiting earnings management practices. However, regulating or imposing a quota of women on boards can create a temporal shortage of qualified women available to take up such positions.",

These jobs are located in a small number ofsectors generally linked to natural resources: naturalist research, forestry sector, public works, water and wastemanagement, etc. In this article, we are interested in two economic policies favoring the development of thesebio- jobs. The government can support demand in sectors concentrating bio-jobs through public procurement, orshe can develop them through targeted exemptions. The most effective and relevant combination of theseinstruments is looked for via an original framework. We show that the action of the government is driven by thenature of the sectors and especially the level of an existing private demand. Then, the level of the wages plays amajor role in the government budget decision. We finally apply these recommendations to French data.",

    "abstract_s":"To what extent is political participation deepened and enriched by the Internet? Isthe Internet more inclusive—especially towards the young—than traditional formsof participation requiring physical contact? Do people learn more by discussing onthe Internet—and especially in online political forums—than by deliberating face-to-face? We aim to answer these questions by presenting the results of research based on the observation of a deliberative experience that allowed both online andface-to-face participation, namely the IDEAL-EU project, carried out by theTuscany (Italy), Catalonia (Spain), and Poitou-Charentes (France) regions. IDEAL-EU was aimed at involving young people—between ages 14 and 30—to discuss theissue of climate change in order to produce a report to be handed to the President of the European Parliament Commission on Climate Change. It first consisted in onlinediscussion forums, and then in an electronic town meeting organized in the threeregions' capitals in November 2008. This town meeting involved both keypad votingand face-to-face discussions in small groups. The comparison of these two stages of the experience allows evaluation of the respective effects of online and face-to-face political discussions on young participants’ political knowledge. Using contentanalysis of websites, direct observation of the assembly, and interviews andquestionnaires completed by both online and assembly participants, we evaluate the respective effects of these different forms of civic engagement for actors' perceived level of knowledge on climate change and on their political competence moregenerally.",

    "abstract_s":"The present study investigates the sources of shareholder wealth gains – as measured by cumulative abnormal returns and premiums – from going private transactions (GPTs). Using data for 314 GPTs from 18 Western European countries, we find that the announcements of GPTs generate a cumulative average abnormal return of about 22% and that pre-transaction shareholders on average receive a raw premium of about 36%. We further find that these shareholder wealth gains increase with the degree of separation of cash-flow and control rights of the pre-transaction ultimate owner and decrease with its ownership interests and with the presence of a second large shareholder. Taken together, these findings support the view that GPTs are expected to mitigate the inefficiencies induced by pre-transaction agency problems between controlling and minority shareholders. Thus, shareholder wealth gains from GPTs reflect the potential additional value that will be created under private ownership.",

    "title_s":"Large Controlling Shareholders and Stock Price Synchronicity",
    "abstract_s":"This paper examines the effect of controlling shareholders on stock price synchronicity by focusing on two salient corporate governance features in a concentrated ownership setting, namely, ultimate cash flow rights and the separation of voting and cash flow rights (i.e., excess control). Using a unique dataset of 654 French listed firms spanning 1998–2007, this study provides evidence that stock price synchronicity increases with excess control, supporting the argument that controlling shareholders tend to disclose less firm-specific information to conceal opportunistic practices. Additionally, this study shows that firms with substantial excess control are more likely to experience stock price crashes, consistent with the conjecture that controlling shareholders are more likely to hoard bad information when their control rights exceed their cash flow rights. Another important finding is that firms’ stock prices are less synchronous and less likely to crash when controlling shareholders own a large fraction of cash flow rights. This is consistent with the argument that controlling shareholders have less incentive to adopt poor disclosure policies and to accumulate bad news, since high cash flow ownership aligns their interests with those of minority investors.",

    "abstract_s":"The current study investigates the determinants of going private (GP) in France. It contrasts a sample of 161 firms that went private between 1997 and 2009 with a propensity-score-matched sample of firms that remained public during the same period. The results indicate that, unlike for firms that remain public, the largest controlling shareholders (LCSs) of GP firms control their firms using an incommensurately small fraction of ultimate cash flow rights. This is consistent with the view that agency problems between large and minority shareholders make public firms less attractive to investors, which reduces the benefits of staying public and encourages the LCSs to take their firms private or accept takeover offers. Additional results show that GP firms have more undervalued stock prices and higher free cash flows than non-GP firms. Expected interest tax shields, low growth opportunities, and pre-GP takeover interest do not seem to affect the probability of GP.",

    "title_s":"On the Relationship between Ownership-Control Structure and Debt Financing: New Evidence from France",
    "abstract_s":"The paper deals with external debt financing in controlling minority structures (CMSs), a very pervasive corporate organizational structure in France outside CAC 40 firms. Since large controlling shareholders in such firms maintain grip on control while owning an incommensurate small fraction of ownership rights, we are in a situation where their interests depart from that of the minority shareholders. Using a sample of 377 French firms, we show that firms featuring a substantial likelihood of expropriation (higher discrepancy between cash flow rights and control rights or group-affiliated), present lower leverage ratios than others due to debt supply restrictions. Contrariwise, the presence of second large controlling shareholder is perceived by external finance suppliers as a pledge against expropriation. Therefore, such firms exhibit high debt levels.",

    "abstract_s":"The purpose of this study is to provide an empirical analysis of the relationship between ownership structure of French firms and their value. Using data for 510 French publicly traded firms, the current study provides evidence in support of the entrenchment hypothesis. The results show that large controlling shareholders maintaining grip on control while holding only small fraction of cash flow rights are inclined to expropriate minority shareholders, which in turn detrimentally affects the firm's valuation. The evidence also indicates that pyramiding is the main device set to unduly entrench the large controlling shareholder. Additional analysis reveals that the identity of the second largest controlling shareholder matters. Sharing control with a family constrains the largest controlling shareholder to steer clear of self-serving behavior. However sharing control with a widely held firm or with a financial institution fosters this self-serving behavior.",

The results show that analysts are more likely to follow ﬁrms both with high discrepancy level between ownership and control and those controlled through pyramiding. These ﬁndings provide empir- ical support to the argument that minority shareholders value private information on ﬁrms with high expropriation likelihood, asking thence for more analyst services. Additional ﬁndings show that analysts are reticent to follow ﬁrms managed by controlling family mem- bers. This is, in part, explained by these ﬁrms’ reliance on private communication channels rather than public disclosure, producing a poor informational environment.",

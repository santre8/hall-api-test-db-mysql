    "title_s":"Urban stormwater source control policies: why and how?",
    "abstract_s":"Stormwater source control is becoming a common strategy for urban stormwater management in many countries. It relies on regulations or other policy instruments compelling or inciting to implement, for each new urban development, small-scale facilities to locally store and manage stormwater. Local authorities that pioneered source control since the 1980s have already observed that small-scale facilities systematically implemented over a catchment are able to influence its hydrological behaviour. This capability is the main strength of source control, as it allows compensation for the negative effects of urbanization. Yet, it also represents its main risk: if initial decision-making is not sufficiently accurate, source control can produce long term negative effects. Because of its current spreading, source control will acquire an increasing role as a driver of hydrological changes in urban catchments, and the directions of these changes depend on current policy-making practices. This paper presents an analysis and a critical discussion of the main objectives that policy-makers attribute to stormwater source control. The investigation is based on a sample of French case studies, completed by a literature review for international comparison. It identifies four main objectives, some typical of urban stormwater management and some more innovative: flood reduction, receiving waters protection, sustainable development, costs reduction. The discussion focuses on how current policy-making practices are able to translate these objectives in concrete policy instruments, and on which knowledge and tools could improve this process. It is shown that for some objectives, basic knowledge is available, but the creation of policy instruments effective at the catchment scale and adapted to local conditions is still problematic. For others, substantial lacks of knowledge exist, casting doubts on long term effectiveness of current policy instruments. Research directions are identified to improve source control policies and thus the future hydrologic behaviour of many urban catchments.",

The proposed methodology corresponds to a convenient alternative to the direct use either of the Craig-Bampton method applied to the three substructures (using the fixed geometric interface modes) or of the flexibility residual approaches initiated by MacNeal (using the free geometric interface modes). In opposite to a geometrical interface which is a topological interface on which there is a direct linkage between the degrees of freedom of substructures, we consider a physical flexible interface which exists in certain present technologies and for which the general framework linear viscoelasticity is used and yields a frequency-dependent damping and stiffness matrices of the physical flexible interface.",

In this work, we are interested in predicting the dynamical response of complex structures presenting several structural scales (for instance, the presence of flexible panels connected to a stiff master structure). For such structures, a high modal density can be observed in the low- and in the medium-frequency bands. This high modal density for the low-frequency band is not the usual case considered by the modal analysis which would require a large number of elastic modes to represent the response with a good accuracy. In this context, a new methodology is introduced for constructing a small-size reduced-order basis adapted to span the global displacements space.",

    "abstract_s":"This study explores the possibility to forecast formaldehyde (HCHO) concentration from past observations in an office. A monitoring campaign of HCHO was performed during 96 days, with a short time-step (1 minute). The monitored formaldehyde time series exhibited, in particular, abrupt changes and structural breaks in variance, that cannot be modelled implicitly using simple models. To overcome this problem, hybrid model for forecasting HCHO time series (characterized by nonlinear and nonstationary behaviour) was used. The periodicities of the data were modelled by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). A Self-Exciting Threshold AutoRegressive (SETAR) model was used to model the FFT component. SETAR models are typically designed to accommodate the nonlinear features and can explain two regimes in a time series. The residuals of the FFT component subtracted from raw data was modelled using a second SETAR model. The output of the two models were summed and compared to raw test data.",

The dislocations are widely dissociated and the separation width between partials being close to 30 angstrom. The translation state of the interfacial structure between partials is different from those of the perfect twin.

    "abstract_s":"At the border between the states of Ceará and Pernambuco (northeast Brazil), the Chapada do Araripe is a high plateau (800–1000 m a.s.l.) formed by a slab of Cenomanian fluvial sandstone. This caprock is underlain by lacustrine or marine Albian layers and older rift deposits. During the Cretaceous, the Araripe basin lay at a palaeoelevation close to sea-level. Through a presentation and discussion of original field and cartographic data we analyse the mechanisms of topographic inversion in this sedimentary basin in relation to local or regional crustal upwarp. The contrast between the plateau — a weakly dissected structural surface — and the surrounding lowlands is explained through a study of the erosional scarps — cuesta-like landforms and their outliers — that fringe the Chapada. No evidence of local tectonic inversion is found. River incision, spring sapping, landslides and other forms of mass movement are listed as efficient processes of topographic inversion and scarp retreat, the rates and patterns of which appear to be controlled by lithological contrasts and conditions of exhumation of the basement. Geometric relationships with regional stepped surfaces (e.g., the low-elevation Sertaneja Surface), exhumed palaeosurfaces and regional drainage systems are analysed. Our estimation of the amplitude of denudation and topographic inversion (0.6–0.7 km) differs significantly from apatite fission-track-derived estimates reported in recent literature, which would imply burial by considerable thicknesses of younger sediments followed by 1.5 km or more of post-rift denudation — not just in the study area, but also in the Tucano–Jatoba basin to the south. The exhumation and reworking of surrounding basement surfaces probably began during the early Cenozoic, as shown to the northwest of the Chapada by the presence of widespread laterites of probable Palaeogene age. A second stage of topographic inversion occurred during the Oligocene or later. This would correspond to the major stages of river incision, partial planation and basin inversion.",

    "abstract_s":"Steep slopes form the marginal scarp of the semi-arid northern Brazilian “Nordeste”, above depressions or corridors connected to a low erosion plain merging seaward with a coastal erosional-gradational piedmont. Dissected pediments and sparse debris fans visible at the base of some escarpments suggest recent erosive activity and possible slope retreat, although most of these forms are decoupled from major valleys. We describe the morphostructural patterns of chosen escarpments, in the basement as well as in the sedimentary cover, and the morphodynamic conditions of their evolution since the Miocene. Only a few scarps show strong structural control. Many of them are mainly inherited landforms, initiated during the Early Cretaceous rifting or the later margin uplift, a situation which suggests long-term stability. Later on, except in one case (the Araripe scarp), only slight or local backwearing took place, associated with downwearing on low surfaces and pediments, probably in diachronic ways. The Neogene clastic sedimentation on piedmonts and coastal areas mainly reflects the occurrence of dry periods inducing widespread stripping of deep soil horizons and erosion of bare rock slopes and surfaces. Dissection stages occurred in periods of more humid climate and\/or low sea level. Marks of strong recent of present activity are mainly registered in the rims of the Chapada do Araripe, owing to favourable structural, hydrogeological and climatic conditions. The moderate volumes of Neogene clastic sediments imply overall low uplift and erosion rates until the Present, favourable to morphological and lithological resistance effects in the landscapes. However, slope instabilities are not uncommon, locally leading to well characterized processes, landforms and deposits of gullying and mass wasting. Therefore, hazards related with slope processes never may be neglected, although only small scale events were recorded in recent times, and times of recurrence of larger events are probably much longer than the historic times.",

    "abstract_s":"Neotectonic movements have been proposed in the literature in order to explain some landforms of the equatorial, passive margin of northeastern Brazil. Its seismo-tectonic activity is concentrated in a few sectors located on or near the coast. Active or recently active structures are mainly identified in Neogene deposits. Identifying a contribution of neotectonics to the morphogeny is difficult in a context where most major morphostructural patterns are explained by Cretaceous tectonics related to oceanic opening and by differential erosion induced by Tertiary epeirogenic uplift. We aim to assess the nature of features considered as possibly neotectonic in origin. Seismogenic faults are not related to significant topographic breaks, except on the coast, where they usually reach only a few meters in height. A study of landforms located near zones of seismo-tectonic activity indicates a possible, probably weak, contribution of neotectonics to the formation of a few high scarps. These scarps occur along or near fault zones reactivated in Cretaceous times. We conclude that neotectonic movements are the result of ongoing deformation along predominantly strike-slip fault zones, with long term deformation rates similar to those recorded by dated landmarks (0.01 mm.yr-1). Despite reported deformation rates that can amount in places to 0.4 mm.yr-1, neotectonic rates are lower than erosion rates. The consequence is that major structural landforms in the region mainly originated in Cretaceous to early Tertiary events.",

    "abstract_s":"At the border between the Ceará, Piauí, and Pernambuco states (northeast Brazil), the high sandstone table called Chapada do Araripe overlooks lower and drier plateaus and depressions shaped into underlying post-rift and rift layers, in the east, or in the basement, to the west and south. The modes and rates of relief inversion that lead the upper layers of the Araripe basin to their culminating position are examined in relation with geological structure and regional uplift, through the presentation and discussion of morphostructural patterns and types of escarpments, differential erosion landforms, soil sequences, modalities of scarp retreat, and possible differential vertical movements (tectonic inversion). The geomorphic and pedological contrast between the plateau (a near-structural surface covered by Ferralsols) and its lower surroundings (either an exhumed Pre-Cenomanian paleosurface covered by Plinthosols, or lower surfaces with relatively immature soils of Luvisol type, often associated with Leptosols) is explained through a study of the evolution of the cuesta-like scarps or glints and outliers that fringe the chapada above sedimentary depressions and basement surfaces. A reconstruction of the conditions and chronology of relief inversion and corresponding area reduction is proposed, according to principles and methods of morphostratigraphy and morphopedology. It brings elements for discussing recently published models of episodic burial and exhumation history, based upon interpretations of thermochronological data obtained in nearby regions. This discussion also bears strong implications about long-term landform evolution in northeast Brazil and other passive margin areas. From a more general point of view, the present work is considered as a case study for analysing processes and rates of vertical erosion and scarp retreat in tropical tabular structures and sandstone plateaus.",

    "abstract_s":"Usually known as prone to severe droughts, the inner Northeast Brazil (“sertão”) is still hardly considered as an area of hazards and risks related to violent geodynamic events. However, such past or present phenomena are now recognized in a few narrow humid mountains exposed to the trade-winds, such as the eastern “Chapada do Araripe”, a high tabular sandstone plateau located at the border between the Ceará and Pernambuco states. Here, a 400-500 m high cuesta-like scarp covered by a dense forest overlooks drier dissected lowlands. The city of Crato (110,000 inhabitants) is built along one of its short rivers, the Rio Grangeiro, 4 km from the rim. Whereas existing works only bear on current and historically observed dynamics, flash-floods, gullying, and small-scale mass movements, we consider a wider range of geodynamic phenomena. So far, only the violent floods that periodically occur along the Grangeiro River have been taken into account in urban management, with the construction of a 2 km long concrete channel through the city. According to our analysis of climate-hydrological data over the last decade, big floods aggravated by this inadequate canalization have devastated the centre almost every year. Our study of landforms and deposits in the city and upstream also evidences largely distributed marks of past large-scale mass movements, debris flows, landslides, and even Sturzstrom. We show the importance of recurrent gravitational dynamics as usual processes in scarp evolution. Since such phenomena induced by favourable climatic and geological factors still might occur in a now densely populated area, and since some of them were catastrophic, they must be included in natural hazards and risks, in spite of the current lack of data on their chronology. Our first results justify further integrated studies of the past and current conditions of occurrence of both high frequency-low magnitude, and low frequency-extreme events identified through short-and long-terms records.",

    "abstract_s":"At the border between the Ceará and Pernambuco states (northeast Brazil), the Chapada do Araripe is a high tabular plateau (900-1000 m a.s.l.) shaped into Cenomanian fluvial conglomerates and sandstones underlain by fossiliferous lacustrine or marine Albian layers. The Araripe basin lay at the time at a palaeoelevation close to palaeosea level. We analyse the mechanisms of relief inversion in the Araripe sedimentary basin in relation with local or regional crustal upwarp, in the light of original field and cartographic data. The contrast between the plateau – a near-structural surface – and the surrounding depressions is explained through a study of the erosion scarps that fringe the chapada above sedimentary depressions (east, southwest: segments with cuesta-like landforms and wide inland “peripheric” depressions; cuesta-like landforms and deep box-valleys without wide depressions) or basement surfaces (north, west, south: glints and outliers). No evidence of tectonic inversion is found. Sapping, landslides and other mass movements appear as common processes of relief inversion and scarp retreat, the rates and results of which appear to be controlled by sediment litholoy and paleolandforms of the rifted basement. Geometric relationships with regional stepped surfaces, in particular the low Sertaneja Surface, and exhumed paleosurfaces are analysed. Our estimation of the amplitude of relief inversion (0.6-0.7 km) differs significantly from AFT-derived estimates reported from Palaeozoic and Mesozoic sandstones, which would imply burial by a considerable thickness of younger section and, later, 1.5 km of post-rift denudation. The exhumation of surrounding basement surfaces probably began very early, as shown to the northwest of the chapada by the presence of widespread Palaeogene laterites. A later stage of basin topographic inversion, in the Oligocene and later, would correspond to the major stages of river incision, partial planation and basin inversion.",

    "abstract_s":"Steep slopes form the marginal scarp of the semi-arid northern Brazilian “Nordeste” and bound inner residual plateaus and ridges rising up to 800-1,200 m. They overlook a low pediplain merging seaward with a well developed coastal erosional-gradational piedmont. Only a few of them coincide with geological contacts and\/or fault zones. Their location, their straight or sinuous outlines, and the presence or lack of residual landforms in front of them give indications on their origin and evolution. Dissected pediments and sparse debris fans visible at the base of some escarpments suggest recent erosive activity and possible slope retreat, although most of these forms are decoupled from major valleys. In order to understand scarp morphology and evolution in a context where various factors (lithology, neotectonics, climatic and eustatic changes) can be considered, we describe the morphostructural patterns of chosen escarpments, as well as the morphodynamic conditions of their evolution since the Neogene. Only a few scarps retained in our study show strong structural control. It could not be determined in all cases whether they are residual or active fault scarps, or fault-line scarps. Most of them, straight or sinuous, controlled or not by local structures, are mainly inherited landforms, initiated during the Cretaceous rifting (south of the Potiguar basin) or later. The Neogene clastic sedimentation on the piedmonts and on coastal areas probably reflect the occurrence of dry periods inducing widespread stripping of deep soil horizons and erosion of bare rock slopes and surfaces, even without tectonic forcing. Dissection stages occurred in periods of more humid climate and\/or low sea level. Only slight or local backwearing of slopes occurred, associated with downwearing on pediments, probably in diachronic ways. The moderate volumes of Neogene clastic sediments imply overall low uplift and erosion rates until the Present, still to be more precisely quantified, and favourable to morphological and lithological resistance effects in the landscapes.",

    "abstract_s":"A method for regional-scale morphostructural mapping that is useful for morphotectonic studies in basement areas is presented for the Baturité massif, Northeastern Brazil. Belonging to an Early Cretaceous intracontinental rift shoulder and to the northern marginal scarp of the Brazilian “Nordeste”, this high plateau is suspected to be a residual relief preserved above a low regional planation surface (the Sertaneja pediplain) and the coastal piedmont, but tectonic controls on several of its outer border scarps cannot be excluded. In order to explain its outstanding position, we use a methodology consisting in integration of a wide set of digital data (SRTM DEM, geological maps, Landsat imagery, etc.) in a Geographic Information System that appears as a relevant technique to compare topographic features with geological structure. The results of the detailed morphostructural mapping reveal that differential erosion has played a predominant role in the geomorphic outlines of the Baturité massif. These observations confirm the incompatibility of important neotectonic movements in the relief differentiation. When replaced in its regional morphotectonic context, they rather suggest the partial preservation of the northwest shoulder of the Neocomian Potiguar rift, giving new constraints for a relevant modelling of the regional morphotectonic evolution.",

Its relief reflects a complex geological history in which the most significant events are the Early Cretaceous rifting, followed by unequal post-rift subsidence, transform oceanic opening (Aptian-Albian), and formation of the margin, with differentiated evolution of compartments inherited from rifting and break-up patterns. On the basis of morphostructural data and of published stratigraphic and thermochronometric results, we propose a reconstruction of its evolution, illustrated by a series of sketch block-diagrammes, and an evaluation of the uplift and erosion values and rates. Through an analysis of the roles of tectono-eustatic controls and morphotectonic-climatic couplings, it offers new insights on the influence of superposed structural legacies in the geomorphic development and lateral variations of marginal escarpments. From our observations, northeastern Brazil appears as an ideal place for calibrating results of low temperature thermochronometry and for developing new conceptual models of morphotectonic evolution of passive margins and marginal scarps.",

    "abstract_s":"Physico-chemical characterization of lead, zinc and cadmium has been carried out on eight samples from both separate and combined sewers. Dissolved and particulate total metal levels have been determined. A speciation scheme has been used ta further divide these phases in two dissolved fractions, bioavailable and stable, and five particulate fractions, ion-exchangeable, acid-soluble, reducible, oxidizable and residual. TotaJ dissolved lead concentrations were found ta be largely below European Community (EC) directives for drinking water production. Lead was represented by stable forms while zinc and cadmium were mainly bioavailable. Particulate concentrations were higher than naturallevels found in the Seine-Nolmandie basin. Zinc was characteristic for municipal effluents, and lead and cadmium were more concentrated in separate sewers. Correlations have been observed between particulate heavy metals and volatile matter on the ring highway, or with iron at the Savigny site. The particulate meral speciation scheme has demonstrated the important dependence of heavy metal distribution on the sampling site, as weil as the potentially more mobile nature of zinc and cadmium, compared to that of lead. The structural modifications undergone by solids during their transport along the sewer networks had a significant impact on particulate metal mobility. This has been clearly noted for lead, whose mobility decreased from upstream ta downstream in the studied system.",

Milled samples were annealed for 30 min in a vacuum at different temperatures (T A) between 700 and 1190 • C. The effects of heat treatment and Mo content on struc-tural and magnetic property changes have been investigated by means of x-ray diffraction using the Rietveld method, transmission electron microscopy and magnetic measurements. For samples annealed at T A > 900 • C the tetragonal ThMn 12 -type structure is identified, while for 700 < T A <900 • C a new out of equilibrium P 6\/mmm type structure was found as the major phase. This novel nanocrystalline phase has never been synthesized before. The correspondent stoichiometry is determined on the basis of the vacancy model. The Rietveld analysis gives a stoichiometry ratio equal to 1:10, for the out of equilibrium hexagonal phase, which is described with three crystallographic transition metal sites: 3g is fully occupied, 6l occupation is limited to hexagons surrounding the Fe dumbbell pairs 2e. We have performed a magnetic and structural study of nanocrystalline metastable P 6\/mmm Sm(Fe 1−x Mo x) 10 , correlated to structural transformation towards its equilibrium derivative I4\/mmm Sm(Fe 1−x Mo x) 12 . A maximum of the coercive field H C (H C > 5 kOe) has been observed for the new hexagonal P 6\/mmm phase suggesting that nanocrystalline Sm(Fe,Mo) 10 , is a semi-hard material, and is potential candidate for magnetic recording.",

The present work aims at elaborating an incremental–iterative numerical method for voxel-based modeling of damage evolution in quasi-brittle microstructures. The iterative scheme based on the Lippmann–Schwinger equation in the real space domain (Yvonnet, in Int J Numer Methods Eng 92:178–205, 2012) is first cast into an incremental form so as to implement nonlinear material models efficiently. In the proposed scheme, local strain increments at material grid points are computed iteratively by a mapping operation through a transformation array, while local stresses are determined using a constitutive model that accounts for material degradation by damage. For validation, benchmark studies and numerical simulations using microtomographic data of concrete are performed. For each test, numerical predictions by the incremental–iterative scheme and the finite element method, respectively, are presented and compared for both global responses and local damage distributions. It is emphasized that the proposed incremental–iterative formulation can be straightforwardly applied in the framework of other Lippmann–Schwinger equation-based schemes, like the fast Fourier transform method.",

    "abstract_s":"Many blockstreams occur in the Miocene volcanic area of Mont Mézenc, eastern Velay, SE Massif Central, France. They were supplied by frost-shattered exposures of lava-flow boundaries, phonolitic domes and other intrusions. These ‘rivers of rock’ are ribbons of chaotically upheaved blocks presenting an openwork structure, are 400 to 1100 m long and 20 to 200 m wide, and are today disconnected from the rock exposures that supplied the debris. Some occur on very low gradient slopes. The largest blockstreams offer evidence of compression ridges and post-depositional block subsidence. Their dynamics and age are not precisely known in the study area and they have been interpreted by default as Late Pleniglacial rock glaciers. Field observations (stratigraphic relations with other surficial deposits, topographic position, distance from bedrock source areas and from talwegs, structural context), however, indicate that the situation is more complex, with new implications for their age, origin and past dynamics. This reconnaissance study proposes a typology of blockstreams for the area. The base of the blockstreams remains inaccessible to direct observation but several ground-penetrating radar transects were carried out in order to map the topography at depth. Results show that the blocks fill gullies 5 to 15 m in depth. At the surface, a sharp textural transition with other slope deposits is clearly detected but the latter grade topographically to the surface of the blockstreams, not to the gullies beneath them. These cross-cutting relations provide a relative chronology not previously established in the case of blockstream deposits.",

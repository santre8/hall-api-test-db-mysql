    "title_s":"The impact of recent reforms on the institutional governance of French universities",
    "abstract_s":"It is usual to identify France as a latecomer in New Public Management (NPM). As stressed by P. Bezes (2003 and 2009 ), while the souci de soi of the French state has always been present and the reform of the management of French public administration has been a recurrent objective during the Fifth Republic, it is only in the late 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s that the NPM doctrine really diffused into the French public system. The important transformations experienced by the higher education system until then (Musselin 2001[2004]) could therefore not be analysed as a consequence of NPM (Musselin and Paradeise 2009). The introduction of NPM methods and solutions in French administration, now in place for a decade, first reached universities in mid-2000 when the new budgetary process that was introduced into French public administration (the LOLF, Loi organique sur les lois de finances ) was also implemented in public higher education institutions. In order to negotiate their budget, they now have to set objectives and indicators that will then be used to measure the achievement of these objectives a year later, when they will write a report about the past year. Further major changes, which will be described below, were introduced after 2005. They not only brought in new instruments and devices to the management of French universities (more competitive processes, performance-based allocation of resources, empowerment of university leaders, etc.), but more broadly affected some of the principles on which the French university system was built and, in particular, the egalitarian principles that maintained a rather low differentiation among French academics and among French universities and the grades they delivered. The aim of this chapter is, therefore, primarily to describe the governance of French universities after the introduction of the recent reforms and answer the following questions: did these changes affect the governance of French universities or did they resist the transformations that aimed at strengthening the presidents, increasing project-based research and providing them with more autonomy and responsibility?",

    "abstract_s":"Purpose - The aim of this paper is to explore interactions between change and stability during the implementation of a specific change initiative (ISO 9000). It attempts to develop a theoretical framework on change and stability management in small firms. Design\/methodology\/approach - This research uses a process approach based on retrospective comparative case study methodology. Data collection in the six companies lasted over a year. This gives the opportunity to contrast failed change initiatives against successful ones. Findings - Two models emerged from this approach; they support the notion that change and stability could be complementary during the different phases of the change initiative the authors analyzed. The findings show that total absence of stability variables in the change initiative could have negative effect on results. Research limitations\/implications - The research is based on a multiple case study approach, which limits the generalizability of the findings. Originality\/value - This is one of the first studies that applies and empirically tests the change and stability relation in small firms.",

    "title_s":"Consumer responses to elimination of overpackaging on private label products",
    "abstract_s":"Purpose – Eliminating overpackaging is a central question in sustainable development, and poses a dilemma for retailers. Since packaging is a differentiation tool for private labels, eliminating it could limit the capacity to give those labels an equivalent image to national brands just as much as it could be a sustainable development opportunity and a positioning instrument. Drawing on the attribution theory framework, this article examines how eliminating overpackaging influences consumers’ perception of products sold under generic and mimic private labels, and their purchase intention. Methodology – This research uses a 2 (overpackaging: present vs. absent) x 2 (brand concept: generic vs. mimic private label) between-subjects experiment on a convenience sample of 217 French consumers. The conceptual framework was tested using ANCOVA and mediation analyses. Findings – Our experiment shows that eliminating overpackaging does have an influence on mimic private labels’ image, particularly on perceived quality, convenience and environmental friendliness. We also find that this influence negatively transfers to purchase intention for mimic private labels through lower perceived quality and convenience. No such effect appears for generic private labels’ image. Value – This study addresses an issue as yet unexplored in marketing – the effect of overpackaging on private label products – and proposes areas for managerial and societal reflection relevant to retail chains interested in eliminating overpackaging.",

    "abstract_s":"This study analyzes academics’ values in relation with the reforms led in the public sector of higher education. We claim that studying values\/attitudes in a given field is critical to anticipate future institutional changes (Greenwood and Hinnings, 1996), since they are often precursors of concrete practices and behaviors (Campbell, 1963; Summers, 1970). As the reforms of higher education led recently in France have stressed the notion of “performance” – present both in the NPM and Neo-Weberian narratives –, we investigate to what extent the adhesion to a culture of performance is compatible with the maintenance of the commitment to the university “publicness” (Bozeman, 2007) – which is antithetical to the ideology promoted by NPM. In addition, investigating the robustness of university publicness contributes to the debate upon the transformation of public servants’ values.",

    "title_s":"All motivated by public service? The links between hierarchical position and public service motivation",
    "abstract_s":"Research into public service motivation is currently witnessing exponential growth. However, the universal application of the concept to all categories of public employees raises questions. Indeed, the origins of the concept, which can be traced back to political science studies in the United States, may suggest that the concept applies mainly to senior management but much less to operatives of various types, whose motivations seem more instrumental . Research into the antecedents of PSM has thus shown that high hierarchical levels were associated with employee profiles with a high level of PSM (Bright, 2005; Camilleri, 2007). Some authors go as far as to consider that the concept does not apply at all to operative jobs (Gabris and Simo, 1995). The purpose of this article is therefore to analyse the differences between the public service motivation of operatives and that of other categories of employees. To do so, we draw on two empirical studies, one quantitative (n = 2 868), conducted among the public employees of cities in 12 countries, and the other qualitative, conducted among public employees working in the technical service of a French town. Our results show that the level of PSM is not lower among operatives but that, on the other hand, it is different in its nature and dimensions. Notes to practitioners The issue of the PSM of operative public employees takes on a managerial dimension. Indeed, it has potential policy implications for human resource management policies to be implemented and on the segmentation of the public employees in the light of these policies. Our results thus argue for the mainstreaming of the public service dimension in the management of executives and would suggest that it is in the interest of public organisations to encourage the public service motivation of their employees by designing tasks in such a way that public employees can better appreciate the result of their work among customers and users.",

The innovations generated or adopted by perfumers, whether they involved new extraction methods or the use of synthetic compounds, not only introduced new creative possibilities but also allowed wider margins on sales. The shift from artisanal fabrication to industrial manufacturing accompanied relatively steep increases in the price of perfumes. Nineteenth-century perfumers developed marketing strategies to build the value of their products and to position them as luxury goods.",

Interests in knowledge management (KM) come from various disciplines: economy, social, engineering. These interests are not often linked. Within the firms, KM practices vary a lot depending on national cultures and on activity sectors. However, one can identify a potential symmetry between the diversity of practices and the partitioning of scientific approaches. Design\/methodology\/approach – In order to synthesize the different approaches in KM, the authors studied the 62 papers published in the first three conferences. To have a first representation of the diversity, they analyzed the keywords that were used: among 173 keywords used by the authors, eight keywords represent 27 per cent of the total amount. Findings – Three main dimensions which emerged from the articles are analysed: the practical dimension, the epistemological point of view, and the intention to define a theory of action. Originality\/value – KM is an emerging domain, especially in French culture. This paper can be seen as a first foundation of the domain, and also a manifesto to develop interdisciplinary research on this topic.",

    "abstract_s":"In the last twenty years, international firms have undergone various changes to become global firms. The inherent innovation potential of these global firms only materializes if the various entities cooperate efficiently and succeed in merging together their contributions. The object of this article is to examine the practical forms that this cooperation takes, so as to detect, by observing actors in global organisations, what barriers and difficulties they meet. This paper presents the empirical study of the dynamics of two R&D teams within a major French industrial group. By studying how the daily teamwork takes place, this article takes a critical look at the new models of organization and assesses how far they really favour innovation.",

    "abstract_s":"This chapter proposes a new configurational framework for multicultural work teams. It argues that in order to grasp national cultures and discover team members' sense -making systems, it is necessary to understand the extent to which the actors diverge or converge in managing collective action. Based on the members'national and professional profiles, institutional contexts and interaction modes as well as their differences in goals, Chevrier proposes 5 types of intercultural teams: strategic coordination teams, mixed operational teams, project teams, professional teams and quasi-homogenous teams. The author also maintains that cross-cultural management may be derived from the general processes of coordination which can be classifed under two categories - interpersonal coordination and interpersonal coordination. The first category includes mutual adjustment and direct supervision. The second category encompasses the standardization of processes, results and values (through organizational ideology) and skills The configurational framework delineates how each type of team can use different cross-cultural management modes to enhance its effectiveness.",

    "abstract_s":"This paper presents exploratory research in which three French peer-to-peer car-sharing companies are studied in terms of how they handle their co-production service models and control deviant customer behavior. The study draws on a theoretical framework based on the literature on customer involvement in service co-production, on deviant customer behavior management, and on the general typology of organizational modes of control proposed by Chiapello (1996). Three co-production models related to three control patterns of consumer behavior are identified. First, the transactional model of industrial co-production is associated with strong, highly instrumented control exercised by the organization. Second, the model of relational co-production is associated with control by the market and delegation to consumers. Third, the model of community co-production is associated with strong control based on the community itself. The paper concludes by discussing the strong links that may exist between co-production systems, control systems and business models for each of the companies studied.",

    "abstract_s":"Paradoxes and tensions arising in the governance of two pluralistic Collective Interest Cooperative Companies (SCICs), Artisans du Monde (AdM) and Websourd, have been studied. We have first identified frictions between social and economic objectives and then between different conflicting logics, specific to each SCIC. Second, the composition of governance bodies has been examined. In AdM, tensions occur among colleges and involve employees and volunteers. In Websourd, conflicts emerge within the employees' college and focus on ambiguity regarding roles between, on one the hand, employees and managers and, on the other, between deaf and hearing people. Finally, concerning governing bodies's operations, a power imbalance among their stakeholders has been noticed. In both organizations, expertise and skills are seen as essential, and members with the most power are conferred the greatest legitimacy.",

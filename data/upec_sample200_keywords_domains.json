    "title_s":"Urban stormwater source control policies: why and how?",
    "abstract_s":"Stormwater source control is becoming a common strategy for urban stormwater management in many countries. It relies on regulations or other policy instruments compelling or inciting to implement, for each new urban development, small-scale facilities to locally store and manage stormwater. Local authorities that pioneered source control since the 1980s have already observed that small-scale facilities systematically implemented over a catchment are able to influence its hydrological behaviour. This capability is the main strength of source control, as it allows compensation for the negative effects of urbanization. Yet, it also represents its main risk: if initial decision-making is not sufficiently accurate, source control can produce long term negative effects. Because of its current spreading, source control will acquire an increasing role as a driver of hydrological changes in urban catchments, and the directions of these changes depend on current policy-making practices. This paper presents an analysis and a critical discussion of the main objectives that policy-makers attribute to stormwater source control. The investigation is based on a sample of French case studies, completed by a literature review for international comparison. It identifies four main objectives, some typical of urban stormwater management and some more innovative: flood reduction, receiving waters protection, sustainable development, costs reduction. The discussion focuses on how current policy-making practices are able to translate these objectives in concrete policy instruments, and on which knowledge and tools could improve this process. It is shown that for some objectives, basic knowledge is available, but the creation of policy instruments effective at the catchment scale and adapted to local conditions is still problematic. For others, substantial lacks of knowledge exist, casting doubts on long term effectiveness of current policy instruments. Research directions are identified to improve source control policies and thus the future hydrologic behaviour of many urban catchments.",

    "title_s":"Harmonic mechanical excitations of steady convective instabilities: a means to get more uniform heat transfers in mixed convection flows?",
    "abstract_s":"In laminar mixed convection flows, steady thermoconvective patterns generate non uniform heat and\/or mass transfers at walls that can be detrimental in some industrial processes. For instance the longitudinal thermoconvective patterns of Poiseuille-Rayleigh-Bénard (PRB) flows generate non uniform thin films or coatings when they are present in cold wall horizontal Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) reactors. The aim of this paper is to show that, when the basic steady flow is convectively unstable against an unsteady flow regime, introducing small harmonic mechanical excitations in the basic flow may enable to obtain more uniform time averaged heat transfers. More specifically, three-dimensional direct numerical simulations are used to characterize the temperature field and wall heat transfer associated with unsteady wavy convective instabilities of PRB flows that result from harmonic excitations of the longitudinal thermoconvective rolls at channel inlet. A design of experiments is used to build cubic response surfaces of the different quantities analyzed (growth length of the wavy rolls, magnitude of their spanwise oscillations, wall Nusselt number ...) on a wide range of the flow parameters. Air PRB flows (Pr=0.71) in channels of aspect ratios equal to Width\/Height=10 and 150 < =Length\/Height < =300, for Reynolds numbers 100 < =Re < =300 and Rayleigh numbers 5000 < =Ra < =16000 are considered. Comparisons with experiments are presented and a good agreement is obtained. The optimal conditions to have uniform heat transfers on the horizontal walls of PRB flows correspond to the minimal growth length of the wavy rolls until saturation and the maximum magnitude of their spanwise oscillations. They are approximately obtained for moderate Reynolds number (Re≈150), high Rayleigh numbers (Ra≈15000), low excitation frequency and rather high excitation magnitude. A discussion of these results for the applications to CVD in horizontal rectangular reactors at atmospheric pressure is finally proposed.",

    "title_s":"The impact of recent reforms on the institutional governance of French universities",
    "abstract_s":"It is usual to identify France as a latecomer in New Public Management (NPM). As stressed by P. Bezes (2003 and 2009 ), while the souci de soi of the French state has always been present and the reform of the management of French public administration has been a recurrent objective during the Fifth Republic, it is only in the late 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s that the NPM doctrine really diffused into the French public system. The important transformations experienced by the higher education system until then (Musselin 2001[2004]) could therefore not be analysed as a consequence of NPM (Musselin and Paradeise 2009). The introduction of NPM methods and solutions in French administration, now in place for a decade, first reached universities in mid-2000 when the new budgetary process that was introduced into French public administration (the LOLF, Loi organique sur les lois de finances ) was also implemented in public higher education institutions. In order to negotiate their budget, they now have to set objectives and indicators that will then be used to measure the achievement of these objectives a year later, when they will write a report about the past year. Further major changes, which will be described below, were introduced after 2005. They not only brought in new instruments and devices to the management of French universities (more competitive processes, performance-based allocation of resources, empowerment of university leaders, etc.), but more broadly affected some of the principles on which the French university system was built and, in particular, the egalitarian principles that maintained a rather low differentiation among French academics and among French universities and the grades they delivered. The aim of this chapter is, therefore, primarily to describe the governance of French universities after the introduction of the recent reforms and answer the following questions: did these changes affect the governance of French universities or did they resist the transformations that aimed at strengthening the presidents, increasing project-based research and providing them with more autonomy and responsibility?",

The proposed methodology corresponds to a convenient alternative to the direct use either of the Craig-Bampton method applied to the three substructures (using the fixed geometric interface modes) or of the flexibility residual approaches initiated by MacNeal (using the free geometric interface modes). In opposite to a geometrical interface which is a topological interface on which there is a direct linkage between the degrees of freedom of substructures, we consider a physical flexible interface which exists in certain present technologies and for which the general framework linear viscoelasticity is used and yields a frequency-dependent damping and stiffness matrices of the physical flexible interface.",

Design\/methodology\/approach - This research uses a process approach based on retrospective comparative case study methodology. Data collection in the six companies lasted over a year. This gives the opportunity to contrast failed change initiatives against successful ones. Findings - Two models emerged from this approach; they support the notion that change and stability could be complementary during the different phases of the change initiative the authors analyzed. The findings show that total absence of stability variables in the change initiative could have negative effect on results. Research limitations\/implications - The research is based on a multiple case study approach, which limits the generalizability of the findings.

    "abstract_s":"In the last few years, evidence theory, also known as Dempster-Shafer theory or belief functions theory, have received growing attention in many fields such as artificial intelligence, computer vision, telecommunications and networks, robotics, and finance. This is due to the fact that imperfect information permeates the real-world applications, and as a result, it must be incorporated into any information system that aims to provide a complete and accurate model of the real world. Although, it is in an early stage of development relative to classical probability theory, evidence theory has proved to be particularly useful to represent and reason with imperfect information in a wide range of real-world applications. In such cases, evidence theory provides a flexible framework for handling and mining uncertainty and imprecision as well as combining evidence obtained from multiple sources and modeling the conflict between them. The purpose of this paper is threefold. First, it introduces the basics of the belief functions theory with emphasis on the transferable belief model. Second, it provides a practical case study to show how the belief functions theory was used in a real network application, thereby providing guidelines for how the evidence theory may be used in telecommunications and networks. Lastly, it surveys and discusses a number of examples of applications of the evidence theory in telecommunications and network technologies.",

    "abstract_s":"In the last few years, Dempster–Shafer theory also known as Theory of Belief Functions (TBF) or Evidence theory has received growing attention in many fields of applications such as finance, technology, biomedicine, etc. This theory may be seen as a generalization framework of different instances such as probability, fuzzy sets, and possibility theories. Using Dempster–Shafer belief functions to express available information allows considering two kinds of uncertainty: aleatory uncertainty due to the variability of the variable of interest in the population and epistemic uncertainty due to a lack of knowledge on the state of the variable. Different sources of uncertainty and imprecision may arise in network and telecommunication domains. Such imperfection may be due to imprecision of many aspects regarding the environment: signal, data link, network, etc. For example, it may be due to communication links that might be unreliable, either due to operational tolerance levels or environmental factors. As detailed in the survey paper proposed par Mustapha Reda Senouci, Abdelhamid Mellouk, Mohamed Abdelkrim Senouci, and Latifa Oukhellou in this special issue, the Theory of Belief Functions has proved to be particularly useful to represent and reason with partial information in a wide range of applications, including signal processing, coding, supervision, localization, resource provisioning, etc. In such case, the belief function theory provides a flexible framework for handling and mining imprecision and uncertainty as well as combining different disparate evidence about uncertain events. Indeed, this theory allows modeling different concepts such as imprecision, ambiguity, and ignorance. Also, a variety of combination operators is available in the fusion process. This special issue of Annals of Telecommunications is intended to provide the recent advances on the use of the Theory of Belief Functions and machine learning approaches in telecommunication and network technologies. It focused on how belief functions and machine learning have affected different aspects (protocols, algorithms, paradigm, energy, signal coding, etc.) for a large family of applications (healthcare, medical, underwater, vehicular, robotic, etc.) using network technologies (sensor networks, MANET, VANET, etc.).",

Fifteen HCV genotype 1-infected patients with compensated cirrhosis, who were nonresponders to prior PEG-IFN\/RBV therapy, were enrolled in a nonrandomized study. HCV RNA and concentrations of PIs, PEG-IFN, and RBV were frequently assessed in the first 12 weeks of treatment and were analyzed using a pharmacokinetic\/viral kinetic model. The two PIs achieved similar levels of molar concentrations (P = 0.5), but there was a significant difference in the 50% effective concentrations (EC50) (P = 0.008), leading to greater effectiveness for telaprevir than for boceprevir in blocking viral production (99.8% versus 99.0%, respectively, P = 0.002). In all patients, the antiviral effectiveness of PEG-IFN was modest (43.4%), and there was no significant contribution of RBV exposure to the total antiviral effectiveness. The second phase of viral decline, which is attributed to the loss rate of infected cells, was slow (0.19 day(-1)) and was higher in patients who subsequently eradicated HCV (P = 0.03). The two PIs achieved high levels of antiviral effectiveness. However, the suboptimal antiviral effectiveness of PEG-IFN\/RBV and the low loss of infected cells suggest that a longer treatment duration might be needed in cirrhotic treatment-experienced patients and that a future IFN-free regimen may be particularly beneficial in these patients.",

    "abstract_s":"The cationic photoinitiating abilities of a series of 'push-pull' sulfonium-based photoacid generators (PAGs) have been investigated. In this linear π-conjugated series, a 4-<i>N,N<\/i>-diphenylaminostilbene subunit is associated with different types of sulfonium substituents, which are connected to the stilbene moiety either in the 4′ position or in the 3′ position. This <i>para<\/i>-to-<i>meta<\/i> substitution effect leads to a strong increase of the quantum yield for acid generation with a maximum value of <i>ca<\/i>. 0.5. Such a positioning effect has a strong influence on the efficiency of the S-C bond cleavage. A detailed photolysis mechanism has been proposed. In contrast to commercially available sulfonium salts, these highly reactive π-conjugated PAGs all exhibit large absorption in the visible range as well as large two-photon absorption cross-sections (δ<sub>max<\/sub> > 600 GM) in the near-infrared region. As a consequence, efficient one and two-photon polymerization reactions are observed at 405 nm and 800 nm, respectively, using typical monomers such as cyclohexene oxide, <i>n<\/i>-butyl vinyl ether or SU-8 photoresists. By the fabrication of well resolved two-dimensional microstructures, we finally demonstrate the potential use of these new generation PAGs in the fields of one and two-photon lithography.",

For such structures, a high modal density can be observed in the low- and in the medium-frequency bands.

A monitoring campaign of HCHO was performed during 96 days, with a short time-step (1 minute). The monitored formaldehyde time series exhibited, in particular, abrupt changes and structural breaks in variance, that cannot be modelled implicitly using simple models. To overcome this problem, hybrid model for forecasting HCHO time series (characterized by nonlinear and nonstationary behaviour) was used. The periodicities of the data were modelled by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). A Self-Exciting Threshold AutoRegressive (SETAR) model was used to model the FFT component. SETAR models are typically designed to accommodate the nonlinear features and can explain two regimes in a time series. The residuals of the FFT component subtracted from raw data was modelled using a second SETAR model. The output of the two models were summed and compared to raw test data.",

Test calculations are also presented using the UCCSD(T)-F12 approach. The asymptotic regions are investigated for different relative orientations of the two moieties. It is shown that the three systems C2 + HX are bound, for intermolecular distances close to 3 Ang, through nucleophilic interactions between C2 and HX for approaches perpendicular to the C-C axis, with decreasing interaction energies from HF to HBr. For HX approaching C2 along its axis, the interactions, governed by the electrophilic character of C2 are decreasing from HBr to HF.

Surprisingly, this question has received little attention from researchers in education studies, sociology and political science. This book aims to fill this gap by exploring school evaluation policies in four European countries: England, France, Scotland and Switzerland. It shows that the same policy tool - promoted in many European and international arenas concerned with good practice in educational governance - can actually give rise in each system to a variety of policy configurations in which forms of state control can differ. Written from a policy sociology perspective, the book aims to go beyond the decline\/permanence dichotomy and proposes a specific conceptual framework within which to consider both contextualised forms of state intervention and their potential similarities and combinations. By doing this, the authors not only aim to counterbalance or supplement dominant views on the Europeanisation and transnationalisation of education policies but also to imagine new possibilities for state policy analysis.",

In keeping with standard spatial discretization methods (e.g., finite elements), the process is discrete. It is further required to exhibit a specified mean, standard deviation, and a global measure of the correlation length. The specification of the random process is completed by imposing that it yields a maximum of the entropy. If no constraint on the sign of the process exists, the maximum entropy is achieved for a Gaussian process the autocorrelation of which is constructed. The case of a positive process is considered next and an algorithm is formulated to simulate the non-Gaussian process yielding the maximum entropy. In the second part of the paper, this non-Gaussian model is used to represent the uncertain friction coefficient in a simple, lumped mass model of an elastic structure resting on a frictional support. The dynamic response of this uncertain system to a random excitation at its end is studied, focusing in particular on the occurrence of slip and stick.",

    "abstract_s":"The main objective of the whole project developed in collaboration (LISA\/LATMOS) is to provide a better understanding of the chemical composition of Titan aerosols laboratory analogs, called tholins, and thereby of their formation pathways. The tholins are produced in the PAMPRE reactor (French acronyme for Aerosols Microgravity Production by Reactives Plasmas) developed at LATMOS. These tholins are generated in levitation (wall effects are thus limited) in a low pressure radiofrequency plasma. Up to now, the determination of the physical and chemical properties of these tholins was achieved after their collection and ex-situ analysis by several methods. Their bulk composition was then determined but their insoluble part is still unknown. Other studies were performed after the transfer of the soluble part of the aerosols to different analytical instruments. Therefore, possible artifacts could have influenced the results. We present the SMARD (a French acronym for Mass Spectrometry of Aerosols by InfraRed Laser Desorption) program. A challenging issue of our work is to perform the soluble and unsoluble parts of PAMPRE tholins' analysis in real time and in situ. The coupling of the PAMPRE reactor to a unique instrument (Single Particle Laser Ablation Mass Spectrometry) developed at LISA should allow determining in real time and in situ the characteristics (chemical composition together with granulometry) of the nanometric aerosols. The later are introduced in the analytical instrument using an aerodynamic lens device. Their detection and aerodynamic diameter are determined using two continuous diode lasers operating at λ = 403 nm. Then, the L2DI (Laser 2 steps Desorption Ionisation) technique is used in order to access to the chemical composition of individual particles: they are vaporized using a 10 μm CO2 pulsed laser and the gas produced is then ionized by a 248 nm KrF Excimer laser. Finally, the molecular ions are analyzed by a 1 m linear time-of-flight mass spectrometer. As a first step, tests have been realized using a model of aerosols particles [Dioctylphthalate, C6H4(COOC8H17)2, PM = 390] as well as tholins which have been solubilized in water. Both types of particles have been introduced in the system via a nebulizer placed at the entrance of the aerodynamic lens device. The results, that demonstrate the feasibility of the L2DI technique, will be presented. Aware that the KrF Excimer laser might induce dissociative ionization and only allow to detect aromatic molecular compounds, we plan to use a VUV (λ = 121.56 nm) laser. This would promote direct ionization (one photon process) of all kinds of species according to their respective threshold. The final step will be to directly analyze the tholins generated in the PAMPRE reactor.",

    "title_s":"The Nearest Neighbor entropy estimate: an adequate tool for adaptive MCMC evaluation",
    "abstract_s":"Many recent and often adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are associated in practice to unknown rates of convergence. We propose a simulation-based methodology to estimate MCMC efficiency, grounded on a Kullback divergence criterion requiring an estimate of the entropy of the algorithm successive densities, computed from iid simulated chains. We recently proved in Chauveau and Vandekerkhove (2013) some consistency results in MCMC setup for an entropy estimate based on Monte-Carlo integration of a kernel density estimate based on Györfi and Van Der Meulen (1989). Since this estimate requires some tuning parameters and deteriorates as dimension increases, we investigate here an alternative estimation technique based on Nearest Neighbor estimates. This approach has been initiated by Kozachenko and Leonenko (1987) but used mostly in univariate situations until recently when entropy estimation has been considered in other fields like neuroscience. Theoretically, we prove that, under certain uniform control conditions, the successive densities of a generic class of Adaptive Metropolis-Hastings algorithms to which most of the strategies proposed in the recent literature belong can be estimated consistently with our method. We then show that in MCMC setup where moderate to large dimensions are common, this estimate seems appealing for both computational and operational considerations, and that the problem inherent to a non neglictible bias arising in high dimension can be overcome. All our algorithms for MCMC simulation and entropy estimation are implemented in an R package taking advantage of recent advances in high performance (parallel) computing.",

The translation state of the interfacial structure between partials is different from those of the perfect twin.

The accelerogram is modeled by a time series represented by a random vector in high dimension. The specifications related to the accelerograms are directly taken into account in the construction of the probability distribution of this random vector by using the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) principle under constraints defined by an appropriate available information. A new algorithm, adapted to the high stochastic dimension, is proposed to identify the Lagrange multipliers introduced in the MaxEnt principle to take into account the constraints. This algorithm is based on (1) the minimization of an appropriate convex functional and (2) the construction of the probability distribution defined as the invariant measure of an Itô Stochastic Differential Equation in order to estimate the integrals in high dimension of the problem. The algorithm is validated through an application for which the available information is related to the envelop of the accelerogram, statistics on the response spectrum, statistics on the Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA), statistics on the Cumulative Absolute Velocity (CAV), statistics on the Arias Intensity (AI), the end-velocity and the end-displacement.",

    "abstract_s":"Purpose – Eliminating overpackaging is a central question in sustainable development, and poses a dilemma for retailers. Since packaging is a differentiation tool for private labels, eliminating it could limit the capacity to give those labels an equivalent image to national brands just as much as it could be a sustainable development opportunity and a positioning instrument. Drawing on the attribution theory framework, this article examines how eliminating overpackaging influences consumers’ perception of products sold under generic and mimic private labels, and their purchase intention. Methodology – This research uses a 2 (overpackaging: present vs. absent) x 2 (brand concept: generic vs. mimic private label) between-subjects experiment on a convenience sample of 217 French consumers. The conceptual framework was tested using ANCOVA and mediation analyses. Findings – Our experiment shows that eliminating overpackaging does have an influence on mimic private labels’ image, particularly on perceived quality, convenience and environmental friendliness. We also find that this influence negatively transfers to purchase intention for mimic private labels through lower perceived quality and convenience. No such effect appears for generic private labels’ image. Value – This study addresses an issue as yet unexplored in marketing – the effect of overpackaging on private label products – and proposes areas for managerial and societal reflection relevant to retail chains interested in eliminating overpackaging.",

    "abstract_s":"At the border between the states of Ceará and Pernambuco (northeast Brazil), the Chapada do Araripe is a high plateau (800–1000 m a.s.l.) formed by a slab of Cenomanian fluvial sandstone. This caprock is underlain by lacustrine or marine Albian layers and older rift deposits. During the Cretaceous, the Araripe basin lay at a palaeoelevation close to sea-level. Through a presentation and discussion of original field and cartographic data we analyse the mechanisms of topographic inversion in this sedimentary basin in relation to local or regional crustal upwarp. The contrast between the plateau — a weakly dissected structural surface — and the surrounding lowlands is explained through a study of the erosional scarps — cuesta-like landforms and their outliers — that fringe the Chapada. No evidence of local tectonic inversion is found. River incision, spring sapping, landslides and other forms of mass movement are listed as efficient processes of topographic inversion and scarp retreat, the rates and patterns of which appear to be controlled by lithological contrasts and conditions of exhumation of the basement. Geometric relationships with regional stepped surfaces (e.g., the low-elevation Sertaneja Surface), exhumed palaeosurfaces and regional drainage systems are analysed. Our estimation of the amplitude of denudation and topographic inversion (0.6–0.7 km) differs significantly from apatite fission-track-derived estimates reported in recent literature, which would imply burial by considerable thicknesses of younger sediments followed by 1.5 km or more of post-rift denudation — not just in the study area, but also in the Tucano–Jatoba basin to the south. The exhumation and reworking of surrounding basement surfaces probably began during the early Cenozoic, as shown to the northwest of the Chapada by the presence of widespread laterites of probable Palaeogene age. A second stage of topographic inversion occurred during the Oligocene or later. This would correspond to the major stages of river incision, partial planation and basin inversion.",

    "abstract_s":"Steep slopes form the marginal scarp of the semi-arid northern Brazilian “Nordeste”, above depressions or corridors connected to a low erosion plain merging seaward with a coastal erosional-gradational piedmont. Dissected pediments and sparse debris fans visible at the base of some escarpments suggest recent erosive activity and possible slope retreat, although most of these forms are decoupled from major valleys. We describe the morphostructural patterns of chosen escarpments, in the basement as well as in the sedimentary cover, and the morphodynamic conditions of their evolution since the Miocene. Only a few scarps show strong structural control. Many of them are mainly inherited landforms, initiated during the Early Cretaceous rifting or the later margin uplift, a situation which suggests long-term stability. Later on, except in one case (the Araripe scarp), only slight or local backwearing took place, associated with downwearing on low surfaces and pediments, probably in diachronic ways. The Neogene clastic sedimentation on piedmonts and coastal areas mainly reflects the occurrence of dry periods inducing widespread stripping of deep soil horizons and erosion of bare rock slopes and surfaces. Dissection stages occurred in periods of more humid climate and\/or low sea level. Marks of strong recent of present activity are mainly registered in the rims of the Chapada do Araripe, owing to favourable structural, hydrogeological and climatic conditions. The moderate volumes of Neogene clastic sediments imply overall low uplift and erosion rates until the Present, favourable to morphological and lithological resistance effects in the landscapes. However, slope instabilities are not uncommon, locally leading to well characterized processes, landforms and deposits of gullying and mass wasting. Therefore, hazards related with slope processes never may be neglected, although only small scale events were recorded in recent times, and times of recurrence of larger events are probably much longer than the historic times.",

    "abstract_s":"Neotectonic movements have been proposed in the literature in order to explain some landforms of the equatorial, passive margin of northeastern Brazil. Its seismo-tectonic activity is concentrated in a few sectors located on or near the coast. Active or recently active structures are mainly identified in Neogene deposits. Identifying a contribution of neotectonics to the morphogeny is difficult in a context where most major morphostructural patterns are explained by Cretaceous tectonics related to oceanic opening and by differential erosion induced by Tertiary epeirogenic uplift. We aim to assess the nature of features considered as possibly neotectonic in origin. Seismogenic faults are not related to significant topographic breaks, except on the coast, where they usually reach only a few meters in height. A study of landforms located near zones of seismo-tectonic activity indicates a possible, probably weak, contribution of neotectonics to the formation of a few high scarps. These scarps occur along or near fault zones reactivated in Cretaceous times. We conclude that neotectonic movements are the result of ongoing deformation along predominantly strike-slip fault zones, with long term deformation rates similar to those recorded by dated landmarks (0.01 mm.yr-1). Despite reported deformation rates that can amount in places to 0.4 mm.yr-1, neotectonic rates are lower than erosion rates. The consequence is that major structural landforms in the region mainly originated in Cretaceous to early Tertiary events.",

    "abstract_s":"At the border between the Ceará, Piauí, and Pernambuco states (northeast Brazil), the high sandstone table called Chapada do Araripe overlooks lower and drier plateaus and depressions shaped into underlying post-rift and rift layers, in the east, or in the basement, to the west and south. The modes and rates of relief inversion that lead the upper layers of the Araripe basin to their culminating position are examined in relation with geological structure and regional uplift, through the presentation and discussion of morphostructural patterns and types of escarpments, differential erosion landforms, soil sequences, modalities of scarp retreat, and possible differential vertical movements (tectonic inversion). The geomorphic and pedological contrast between the plateau (a near-structural surface covered by Ferralsols) and its lower surroundings (either an exhumed Pre-Cenomanian paleosurface covered by Plinthosols, or lower surfaces with relatively immature soils of Luvisol type, often associated with Leptosols) is explained through a study of the evolution of the cuesta-like scarps or glints and outliers that fringe the chapada above sedimentary depressions and basement surfaces. A reconstruction of the conditions and chronology of relief inversion and corresponding area reduction is proposed, according to principles and methods of morphostratigraphy and morphopedology. It brings elements for discussing recently published models of episodic burial and exhumation history, based upon interpretations of thermochronological data obtained in nearby regions. This discussion also bears strong implications about long-term landform evolution in northeast Brazil and other passive margin areas. From a more general point of view, the present work is considered as a case study for analysing processes and rates of vertical erosion and scarp retreat in tropical tabular structures and sandstone plateaus.",

    "abstract_s":"Usually known as prone to severe droughts, the inner Northeast Brazil (“sertão”) is still hardly considered as an area of hazards and risks related to violent geodynamic events. However, such past or present phenomena are now recognized in a few narrow humid mountains exposed to the trade-winds, such as the eastern “Chapada do Araripe”, a high tabular sandstone plateau located at the border between the Ceará and Pernambuco states. Here, a 400-500 m high cuesta-like scarp covered by a dense forest overlooks drier dissected lowlands. The city of Crato (110,000 inhabitants) is built along one of its short rivers, the Rio Grangeiro, 4 km from the rim. Whereas existing works only bear on current and historically observed dynamics, flash-floods, gullying, and small-scale mass movements, we consider a wider range of geodynamic phenomena. So far, only the violent floods that periodically occur along the Grangeiro River have been taken into account in urban management, with the construction of a 2 km long concrete channel through the city. According to our analysis of climate-hydrological data over the last decade, big floods aggravated by this inadequate canalization have devastated the centre almost every year. Our study of landforms and deposits in the city and upstream also evidences largely distributed marks of past large-scale mass movements, debris flows, landslides, and even Sturzstrom. We show the importance of recurrent gravitational dynamics as usual processes in scarp evolution. Since such phenomena induced by favourable climatic and geological factors still might occur in a now densely populated area, and since some of them were catastrophic, they must be included in natural hazards and risks, in spite of the current lack of data on their chronology.

    "title_s":"The Chapada do Araripe (Northeast Brazil): shallow basin inversion, implications for regional uplift and denudation history",
    "abstract_s":"At the border between the Ceará and Pernambuco states (northeast Brazil), the Chapada do Araripe is a high tabular plateau (900-1000 m a.s.l.) shaped into Cenomanian fluvial conglomerates and sandstones underlain by fossiliferous lacustrine or marine Albian layers. The Araripe basin lay at the time at a palaeoelevation close to palaeosea level. We analyse the mechanisms of relief inversion in the Araripe sedimentary basin in relation with local or regional crustal upwarp, in the light of original field and cartographic data. The contrast between the plateau – a near-structural surface – and the surrounding depressions is explained through a study of the erosion scarps that fringe the chapada above sedimentary depressions (east, southwest: segments with cuesta-like landforms and wide inland “peripheric” depressions; cuesta-like landforms and deep box-valleys without wide depressions) or basement surfaces (north, west, south: glints and outliers). No evidence of tectonic inversion is found. Sapping, landslides and other mass movements appear as common processes of relief inversion and scarp retreat, the rates and results of which appear to be controlled by sediment litholoy and paleolandforms of the rifted basement. Geometric relationships with regional stepped surfaces, in particular the low Sertaneja Surface, and exhumed paleosurfaces are analysed. Our estimation of the amplitude of relief inversion (0.6-0.7 km) differs significantly from AFT-derived estimates reported from Palaeozoic and Mesozoic sandstones, which would imply burial by a considerable thickness of younger section and, later, 1.5 km of post-rift denudation. The exhumation of surrounding basement surfaces probably began very early, as shown to the northwest of the chapada by the presence of widespread Palaeogene laterites. A later stage of basin topographic inversion, in the Oligocene and later, would correspond to the major stages of river incision, partial planation and basin inversion.",

    "abstract_s":"Steep slopes form the marginal scarp of the semi-arid northern Brazilian “Nordeste” and bound inner residual plateaus and ridges rising up to 800-1,200 m. They overlook a low pediplain merging seaward with a well developed coastal erosional-gradational piedmont. Only a few of them coincide with geological contacts and\/or fault zones. Their location, their straight or sinuous outlines, and the presence or lack of residual landforms in front of them give indications on their origin and evolution. Dissected pediments and sparse debris fans visible at the base of some escarpments suggest recent erosive activity and possible slope retreat, although most of these forms are decoupled from major valleys. In order to understand scarp morphology and evolution in a context where various factors (lithology, neotectonics, climatic and eustatic changes) can be considered, we describe the morphostructural patterns of chosen escarpments, as well as the morphodynamic conditions of their evolution since the Neogene. Only a few scarps retained in our study show strong structural control. It could not be determined in all cases whether they are residual or active fault scarps, or fault-line scarps. Most of them, straight or sinuous, controlled or not by local structures, are mainly inherited landforms, initiated during the Cretaceous rifting (south of the Potiguar basin) or later. The Neogene clastic sedimentation on the piedmonts and on coastal areas probably reflect the occurrence of dry periods inducing widespread stripping of deep soil horizons and erosion of bare rock slopes and surfaces, even without tectonic forcing. Dissection stages occurred in periods of more humid climate and\/or low sea level. Only slight or local backwearing of slopes occurred, associated with downwearing on pediments, probably in diachronic ways. The moderate volumes of Neogene clastic sediments imply overall low uplift and erosion rates until the Present, still to be more precisely quantified, and favourable to morphological and lithological resistance effects in the landscapes.",

    "abstract_s":"A method for regional-scale morphostructural mapping that is useful for morphotectonic studies in basement areas is presented for the Baturité massif, Northeastern Brazil. Belonging to an Early Cretaceous intracontinental rift shoulder and to the northern marginal scarp of the Brazilian “Nordeste”, this high plateau is suspected to be a residual relief preserved above a low regional planation surface (the Sertaneja pediplain) and the coastal piedmont, but tectonic controls on several of its outer border scarps cannot be excluded. In order to explain its outstanding position, we use a methodology consisting in integration of a wide set of digital data (SRTM DEM, geological maps, Landsat imagery, etc.) in a Geographic Information System that appears as a relevant technique to compare topographic features with geological structure. The results of the detailed morphostructural mapping reveal that differential erosion has played a predominant role in the geomorphic outlines of the Baturité massif. These observations confirm the incompatibility of important neotectonic movements in the relief differentiation. When replaced in its regional morphotectonic context, they rather suggest the partial preservation of the northwest shoulder of the Neocomian Potiguar rift, giving new constraints for a relevant modelling of the regional morphotectonic evolution.",

    "abstract_s":"Rich in paleolandforms, the northern Brazilian “Nordeste” offers unique opportunities to reconstruct its history by morphostratigraphic methods, to obtain reliable timings and rates of morphotectonic evolution as well as depths of denudation, and to constrain available models of passive margins. Its relief reflects a complex geological history in which the most significant events are the Early Cretaceous rifting, followed by unequal post-rift subsidence, transform oceanic opening (Aptian-Albian), and formation of the margin, with differentiated evolution of compartments inherited from rifting and break-up patterns. On the basis of morphostructural data and of published stratigraphic and thermochronometric results, we propose a reconstruction of its evolution, illustrated by a series of sketch block-diagrammes, and an evaluation of the uplift and erosion values and rates. Through an analysis of the roles of tectono-eustatic controls and morphotectonic-climatic couplings, it offers new insights on the influence of superposed structural legacies in the geomorphic development and lateral variations of marginal escarpments. From our observations, northeastern Brazil appears as an ideal place for calibrating results of low temperature thermochronometry and for developing new conceptual models of morphotectonic evolution of passive margins and marginal scarps.",

    "abstract_s":"Two Divisions of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), namely Physical Chemistry (Commission I.7 on Biophysical Chemistry, formerly Steering Committee on Biophysical Chemistry) and Analytical Chemistry (Commission V.5 on Electroanalytical Chemistry), have prepared recommendations on the definition, classification and nomenclature related to electrochemical biosensors; these recommendations could, in the future, be extended to other types of biosensors.An electrochemical biosensor is a self-contained integrated device, which is capable of providing specific quantitative or semi-quantitative analytical information using a biological recognition element (biochemical receptor) which is retained in direct spatial contact with an electrochemical transduction element. Because of their ability to be repeatedly calibrated, we recommend that a biosensor should be clearly distinguished from a bioanalytical system, which requires additional processing steps, such as reagent addition. A device which is both disposable after one measurement, i.e. single use, and unable to monitor the analyte concentration continuously or after rapid and reproducible regeneration should be designated a single-use biosensor.Biosensors may be classified according to the biological specificity-conferring mechanism or, alternatively, the mode of physicochemical signal transduction. The biological recognition element may be based on a chemical reaction catalysed by, or on an equilibrium reaction with, macromolecules that have been isolated, engineered or present in their original biological environment. In the latter case, equilibrium is generally reached and there is no further, if any, net consumption of analyte(s) by the immobilized biocomplexing agent incorporated into the sensor. Biosensors may be further classified according to the analytes or reactions that they monitor: direct monitoring of analyte concentration or of reactions producing or consuming such analytes; alternatively, an indirect monitoring of inhibitor or activator of the biologicalrecognition element (biochemical receptor) may be achieved.A rapid proliferation of biosensors and their diversity has led to a lack of rigour in defining their performance criteria. Although each biosensor can only truly be evaluated for a particular application, it is still useful to examine how standard protocols for performance criteria may be defined in accordance with standard IUPAC protocols or definitions. Thesecriteria are recommended for authors, referees and educators and include calibration characteristics (sensitivity, operational and linear concentration range, detection and quantitative determination limits), selectivity, steady-state and transient response times, sample throughput, reproducibility, stability and lifetime.Republication or reproduction of this report or its storage and\/or dissemination by electronic means is permitted without the need for formal IUPAC permission on condition that an acknowledgement, with full reference to the source along with use of the copyright symbol q, the name IUPAC and the year of publication are prominently visible. Publication of a translation into another language is subject to the additional condition of prior approval from the relevant IUPAC National Adhering Organization.",

    "abstract_s":"The importance of dissolved oxygen level in determining the platinum electrode potential in activated sludge has been clearly demonstrated by current-potential curves plotted at different oxygen concentration. Tests have been carried out, in the laboratory and in full scale treatment plants, to define the relationship between the platinum electrode potential at equilibrium (Eh) and the dissolved oxvgen [02) concentration in the activated sIudqe. These two parameters obey a law in the form Eh = a + b log [O2]. The measured values of coefficients a and b differ widely to those found from the oxygen reduction reaction in water (a = 0.8 V at pH 7 and b = 15 mV per decade). Factors a and b mainly depend on the sludge loading, the aeration conditions and the sludge concentration. Using non-polished stationary platinum ring electrodes, the following values of a were obtained (at pH between 7 and 7.6): + 410 mV\/NHE for sludge aerated for several hours without feeding, + 265 mV\/NHE for over-aerated\/low-loaded sludge (Cm = 0.2 kg BOD.kg MLVSS-1.day-1). Factor b would seem to lie between 55 and 65 mV when the sludge is continuously aerated without feeding. At low loads with excess aeration, it lies between 70 and 90 mV. When the medium is slightly septic at low dissolved oxygen concentrations (insufficient daily aeration time, high sludge concentration or aerators shut down for too long periods), factor b increases and can reach 200 mV. In the same way, at high loads, factor b can become 150 mV. These results demonstrate the importance of dissolved oxygen concentration in the mechanisms which determine the metal electrode potentials in activated sludge. They also illustrate the role that the electroactive species play in the process. The type and concentration of these species depend on parameters such as the sludge loading, the overall oxygen supply, the aeration sequence and the sludge concentration.",

In graph-based frameworks, such operators basically rely on symmetric adjacency relations between pixels. In this article, we introduce a notion of directed connected operators for hierarchical image processing, by also considering non-symmetric adjacency relations. The induced image representation models are no longer partition hierarchies (i.e., trees), but directed acyclic graphs that generalize standard morphological tree structures such as component trees, binary partition trees or hierarchical watersheds. We describe how to efficiently build and handle these richer data structures, and we illustrate the versatility of the proposed framework in image filtering and image segmentation.",

    "abstract_s":"Physico-chemical characterization of lead, zinc and cadmium has been carried out on eight samples from both separate and combined sewers. Dissolved and particulate total metal levels have been determined. A speciation scheme has been used ta further divide these phases in two dissolved fractions, bioavailable and stable, and five particulate fractions, ion-exchangeable, acid-soluble, reducible, oxidizable and residual. TotaJ dissolved lead concentrations were found ta be largely below European Community (EC) directives for drinking water production. Lead was represented by stable forms while zinc and cadmium were mainly bioavailable. Particulate concentrations were higher than naturallevels found in the Seine-Nolmandie basin. Zinc was characteristic for municipal effluents, and lead and cadmium were more concentrated in separate sewers. Correlations have been observed between particulate heavy metals and volatile matter on the ring highway, or with iron at the Savigny site. The particulate meral speciation scheme has demonstrated the important dependence of heavy metal distribution on the sampling site, as weil as the potentially more mobile nature of zinc and cadmium, compared to that of lead. The structural modifications undergone by solids during their transport along the sewer networks had a significant impact on particulate metal mobility. This has been clearly noted for lead, whose mobility decreased from upstream ta downstream in the studied system.",

    "abstract_s":"Of small species capable of reaching a platinum working electrode from biological samples, calcium cations have been found to inhibit significantly glucose biosensor responses. The sensitivities to glucose of sensors immersed in carbonate buffer saline solutions decreased when 0.5 mM calcium chloride was added. The degree of inhibition was proportional to the glucose response in the absence of calcium (0-17% of the normalized current). Likewise, sensor sensitivities to hydrogen peroxide decreased, in the 5-90% range, in the presence of 0.5 mM calcium. Bare Pt-Ir wires show a reversible inhibition of hydrogen peroxide sensitivity. This reversible inhibition is directly related to the decrease of hydrogen peroxide oxidation rate at the platinum anode: this has been evidenced, using rotating disk electrodes, by plotting Koutecky-Levich plots. Such inhibition has been found both for free and chelated calcium cations at levels below 1 mM. Several hypotheses for possible reactions between platinum, hydrogen per-oxide and calcium are discussed.",

    "title_s":"Electrochemical biosensors: recommended definitions and classification",
    "abstract_s":"Two Divisions of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), namely Physical Chemistry (Commission I.7 on Biophysical Chemistry formerly Steering Committee on Biophysical Chemistry) and Analytical Chemistry (Commission V.5 on Electroanalytical Chemistry) have prepared recommendations on the definition, classification and nomenclature related to electrochemical biosensors; these recommendations could, in the future, be extended to other types of biosensors. An electrochem-ical biosensor is a self-contained integrated device, which is capable of providing specific quantitative or semi-quantitative analytical information using a biological recognition element (biochemical receptor) which is retained in direct spatial contact with an electrochemical transduction element. Because of their ability to be repeatedly calibrated, we recommend that a biosensor should be clearly distinguished from a bioanalytical system, which requires additional processing steps, such as reagent addition. A device that is both disposable after one measurement, i.e. single use, and unable to monitor the analyte concentration continuously or after rapid and reproducible regeneration, should be designated a single use biosensor. Biosensors may be classified according to the biological specificity-conferring mechanism or, alternatively, to the mode of physico-chemical signal transduction. The biological recognition element may be based on a chemical reaction catalysed by, or on an equilibrium reaction with macromolecules that have been isolated, engineered or present in their original biological environment. In the latter cases, equilibrium is generally reached and there is no further, if any, net consumption of analyte(s) by the immobilized biocomplexing agent incorporated into the sensor. Biosensors may be further classified according to the analytes or reactions that they monitor: direct monitoring of analyte concentration or of reactions producing or consuming such analytes; alternatively, an indirect monitoring of inhibitor or activator of the biological recognition element (biochemical receptor) may be achieved. A rapid proliferation of biosensors and their diversity has led to a lack of rigour in defining their performance criteria. Although each biosensor can only truly be evaluated for a particular application, it is still useful to examine how standard protocols for performance criteria may be defined in accordance with standard IUPAC protocols or definitions. These criteria are recommended for authors, referees and educators and include calibration characteristics (sensitivity, operational and linear concentration range, detection and quantitative determination limits), selectivity, steady-state and transient response times, sample throughput, reproducibility, stability and lifetime.",

    "abstract_s":"River basin metal pollution originates from heavy industries (plating, automobile) and from urban sources (Paris conurbation: 2740 km2 , 9.47 million inhabitants). The natural sources of metal have been found to be limited due to sedimentary nature of this catchment and to the very low river sediment transport (10 t km − 2 y − 1). Several types of data have been collected to build the metal budget within the whole Seine River basin: field surveys, economical statistics and environmental models. Environmental contamination and related fluxes have been measured on atmospheric fallout, rural streams particles, and Seine River particles upstream and downstream of Paris and at river mouth. Metal pathways and budgets have been set up for (i) a typical cultivated area, (ii) a Paris combined sewer system, (iii) Paris conurbation and (iv) the whole catchment metal retention effect in floodplain and dredged material. Metal fluxes to the estuary have been decomposed into natural, urban domestic and other sources. The latter are within 1–2 orders of magnitude larger than waste water fluxes directly released into rivers according to an industrial census. These fluxes have been further compared to the annual use (1994–2003) of these metals. Metal excess fluxes exported by the river are now a marginal leak of metal inputs to the catchment (i.e. \"raw\" metals, metals in goods, atmospheric fallout), generally from 0.2 to 5‰. However, due to the very limited dilution power in this basin, the contamination of particles is still relatively high. The Seine River basin is gradually storing metals, mostly in manufactured products used in construction, but also in various waste dumps, industrial soils, agricultural and flood plain soils.",

This work, led by two different research groups, allowed to reach two main goals: to define a simple analytical procedure to secure accurate shipboard sampling and analysis of atmospheric deposition, and to assess anthropogenic impacts of heavy metals to the environment. The first step about the validation step showed that the prevalent deposition type was dry deposition which represents 40, 60 and 80% for Cd, Cu and Pb, respectively. This prevalence of dry deposition in total atmospheric fallout supported the necessity of funnel wall rinsing which contains 30, 50 and 40% of collected Cd, Cu and Pb, respectively. Moreover, the reproducibility of atmospheric deposition collection was determined. The second step was performed by comparing two sampling sites. A rural sampling site, situated in Morvan's regional park (250 km south-east of Paris), was chosen for its isolation from any local and regional contamination sources. Fluxes obtained in this area were compared with those obtained at an urban site (Creteil, suburb of Paris) allowing comparison between urban and rural areas and demonstrating the impact of anthropogenic activities on atmospheric deposition of Cr, Cu and Pb.",

Comparative study with and without compatibilizing copolymer agent (maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene: PP-g-AM) was conducted. The obtained results were interpreted in terms of silica nanoparticle-silica nanoparticle and silica nanoparticle-polymer interactions. These results have shown that the addition of nanofillers improves the properties of the nanocomposites. From transmission electron microscopy, it was found that agglomerations of silica particles into the PP matrix increased in average size with increasing silica contents, except in presence of the copolymer. Storage modulus values of the nanocomposites measured by dynamic mechanical thermal analysis were sensitive to the microstructure of the nanocomposites. Higher silica contents resulted in higher storage modulus, revealing that the material became stiffer. By adding the compatibilizer, a further increase of storage modulus was observed due to the finer dispersion of the filler in the matrix and the increased interfacial adhesion. Crystallization rates were found to increase with the increase of silica nanoparticles as well as PP-g-MA content. In addition, silica nanoparticles and the compatibilizing agent present centers of germination and nucleation of crystallites. Thus, the use of the coupling agent resulted in a further enhancement of mechanical properties of the nanocomposites due to the reduction of silica agglomeration.",

    "abstract_s":"Nitrogen-rich refractory organics are scarce phases recovered as a fraction of stratospheric IDPs and constitute the bulk of the organic matter of some ultracarbonaceous Antarctic micrometeorites. They are likely formed under very specific conditions within a nitrogen-rich environment and may provide valuable clues on the origin of the population of interplanetary dusts accreted by Earth. In this study, we produced relevant analogs of such refractory organics characterized in three ultracarbonaceous Antarctic micrometeorites, starting from the carbonization of an HCN polymer and a tholin. Indeed, carbonization is a process that can increase the polyaromatic character toward a structure similar to that observed in these cosmomaterials. Both these precursors were degraded in an Ar atmosphere at 300, 500, 700 and 1000°C over ∼1 hour and characterized by elemental analysis, micro-FTIR and Raman micro-spectroscopy (at 244 and 514 nm excitation wavelengths). Our results show that the precursors evolve along distinct chemical and structural pathways during carbonization and that the influence of the precursor structure is still very strong at 1000°C. Interestingly, these different carbonization routes appear in the spectral characteristics of the G and D bands of their Raman spectra. Several of the residues present chemical and structural similarities with three recently studied ultracarbonaceous micrometeorites [Dobrica et al. (2011)Meteoritics Planet. Sci.46, 1363; Dartois et al. (2013)Icarus224, 243] and with N-rich inclusions in stratospheric IDPs. However the residues do not simultaneously account for the carbon structure (Raman) and the chemical composition (IR, N\/C ratio). This indicates that the precursors and\/or heating conditions in our experiments are not fully relevant. Despite this lack of full relevancy, the formation of a polyaromatic structure fairly similar to that of UCAMMs and IDPs suggests that the origin of N-rich refractory organics lies in a thermal process in the proto-solar disk, however radiolysis cannot be excluded.",

    "abstract_s":"Parallelism is becoming more important nowadays due to the increasing use of multiprocessor systems. In this paper, we study the problem of scheduling periodic parallel real-time Directed Acyclic graph (DAG) tasks on m homogeneous multiprocessor systems. A DAG task is an example of inter-subtask parallelism. It consists of a collection of dependent subtasks under precedence constraints. The dependencies between subtasks make scheduling process more challenging. We propose a stretching algorithm applied on each DAG tasks to transform them into a set of independent sequential threads with intermediate offsets and deadlines. The threads obtained with the transformation are two types, (i) fully-stretched master threads with utilization equal to 1 and (ii) constrained-deadline independent threads. The fully-stretched master threads are assigned to dedicated processors and the remaining processors m' ≤ m, are scheduled using global EDF scheduling algorithm. Then, we prove that preemptive global EDF scheduling of stretched threads has a resource augmentation bound equal to (3+ √ 5)\/2 for all tasksets with n < ϕ * m , where n is the number of tasks in the taskset and ϕ is the golden ratio 1 .",

These computations are performed using various density functional theories with and without inclusion of Grimme’s (D3) dispersion correction. For small clusters, we also carried out wavefunction based ab initio (MP2 and SCS-MP2) computations for comparison. Vibrational, AIM and NBO analyses clearly reveal the occurrence of charge transfer (CT) through covalent (N1-Au) and noncovalent interactions that play important roles in the stability of the Im@Aun complexes with anchor assisted H-bonds (Cα-H•••Au). Therefore, gold clusters can act as H-bond acceptor with biomolecules for development of new materials and applications. Our study establishes also the ability and reliability of PBE0 and M05-2X functionals compared to B3LYP and PBE for the accurate description of covalent and noncovalent interactions between Im and gold clusters since they lead to close agreement with MP2. Finally, we show that Au8 cluster may be viewed as large enough to mimic 3D gold surface.",

However, since these are long-ranged and fast decreasing interactions, hierarchical algorithms like the Fast Multipole Method (FMM) are well suited for their fast evaluation. The relatively low accuracy required for the interaction forces between dislocations brought us to develop a more efficient approximation method for the farfield. On the other hand, the nearfield interactions are still evaluated analytically, which required a rather performant implementation (AVX, GPU...). Regarding parallelism, our code benefits from a hybrid OpenMP\/MPI paradigm and a cache-conscious data structure. Finally, an accurate handling of topological elements intersecting the structure of the octree was considered. The latter feature implied careful modifications of the P2M\/L2P operators in order to deal with shared memory model of parallelism.",

The computation of the internal elastic forces is by far the most resources consuming step in DD simulations, which is even more true for anisotropic elasticity in the absence of explicit Green's function. L. Dupuy, J. Soulacroix and M. Fivel showed that the approaches based on Willis-Steed-Lothe or Brown formulae can be accelerated using spherical harmonics expansions of the Stroh matrices. This feature was implemented in the DD code OptiDis in order to power the anisotropic forces computation.

After optimization of the SPME method for the analysis of TFR, partition coefficients (KDOM) with three different sources ofDOM were determined in buffered solutions at pH 7. Commercial humic acids and DOM fractions isolated from two surface waters were used. The values of log KDOM varied from 4.3 to 5.8, depending on the nature of the organic material. A good correlation was established between log KDOM and DOMproperties (as measured with the H\/O atomic ratio and UV absorbance), in agreement with literature data. This is consistent with the effect of polarity and aromaticity for governing DOM-pollutant associations, regardless of the origin of DOM. This association phenomenon is relevant to better understand the behavior of pesticides in the environment since it controls part of pesticide leaching and fate in aquatic systems.",

    "abstract_s":"The Driver-Pressures-State-Impact-Response approach is applied to heavy metals in the Seine River catchment (65,000 km(2); 14 million people of which 10 million are aggregated within Paris megacity; 30% of French industrial and agricultural production). The contamination pattern at river mouth is established on the particulate material at different time scales: 1930-2000 for floodplain cores, 1980-2003 for suspended particulate matter (SPM) and bed-sediments, 1994-2003 for atmospheric fallout and annual flood deposits. The Seine has been among the most contaminated catchments with maximum contents recorded at 130 mg kg(-1) for Cd, 24 for Hg, 558 for Pb, 1620 for Zn, 347 for Cu, 275 for Cr and 150 for Ni. Today, the average levels for Cd (1.8 mg kg(-1)), Hg (1.08), Pb (108), Zn (370), Cu (99), Cr (123) and Ni (31) are much lower but still in the upper 90% of the global scale distribution (Cr and Ni excepted) and well above the natural background values determined on pre-historical deposits. All metal contents have decreased at least since 1955\/65, well before metal emission regulations that started in the mid 1970's and the metal monitoring in the catchment that started in the early 1980's. In the last 20 y, major criteria changes for the management of contaminated particulates (treated urban sludge, agricultural soils, dredged sediments) have occurred. In the mid 1990's, there was a complete shift in the contamination assessment scales, from sediment management and water usage criteria to the good ecological state, now required by the 2000 European Directive. When comparing excess metal outputs, associated to river SPM, to the average metal demand within the catchment from 1950 to 2000, the leakage ratios decrease exponentially from 1950 to 2000 for Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn, meanwhile, a general increase of the demand is observed: the rate of recycling and\/or treatment of metals within the anthroposphere has been improved ten-fold. Hg environmental trajectory is very specific: there is a marked decontamination from 1970 to 2000, but the leakage ratio remains very high (10 to 20%) during this period. Drivers and Pressures are poorly known prior to 1985; State evolution since 1935 has been reconstructed from flood plain cores analysis; Impacts were maximum between 1950 and 1970 but remained unknown due to analytical limitation and lack of awareness. Some Responses are lagging 10 y behind monitoring and have much evolved in the past 10 y.",

As the reforms of higher education led recently in France have stressed the notion of “performance” – present both in the NPM and Neo-Weberian narratives –, we investigate to what extent the adhesion to a culture of performance is compatible with the maintenance of the commitment to the university “publicness” (Bozeman, 2007) – which is antithetical to the ideology promoted by NPM. In addition, investigating the robustness of university publicness contributes to the debate upon the transformation of public servants’ values.",

    "abstract_s":"This paper is concerned with the derivation of a generic sampling technique for a class of non-Gaussian vector-valued random fields. Such an issue typically arises in uncertainty quantification for complex systems, where the input coefficients associated with the elliptic operators must be identified by solving statistical inverse problems. Specifically, we consider the case of non-Gaussian random fields with values in some arbitrary bounded or semi-bounded subsets of R^n. The approach involves two main features. The first one is the construction of a family of random fields converging, at a user-controlled rate, towards the target random field. Each of these auxialiary random fields can be subsequently simulated by solving a family of Itô stochastic differential equations. The second ingredient is the definition of an adaptive discretization algorithm. The latter allows refining the integration step on-the-fly and prevents the scheme from diverging. The proposed strategy is finally exemplified on three examples, each of which serving as a benchmark, either for the adaptivity procedure or for the convergence of the diffusions.",

    "abstract_s":"In this paper, we focus on the semi-partitioned scheduling of sporadic tasks with constrained deadlines and identical processors. We study two cases of semi-partitioning: (i) the case where the worst case execution time (WCET) of a job can be portioned, each portion being executed on a dedicated processor, according to a static pattern of migration; (ii) the case where the jobs of a task are released on a processor, 1 time out of p, where p is an integer at most equal to the number of processors, according to a round-robin migration pattern. The first approach has been investigated in the state-of-the-art by migrating a job at its local deadline, computed from the deadline of the task it belongs to. We study several local deadline assignment heuristics (fair, based on processor utilization and based on the minimum acceptable local deadline for a job on a processor). In both cases, we propose feasibility conditions for the schedulability of sporadic tasks scheduled using earliest deadline first (EDF) semi-partitioned scheduling. We show that the load function used for global scheduling to establish the feasibility of sporadic task sets exhibits interesting properties in the semi-partitioning context. We carry out simulations to study the performance of the two approaches in terms of success rate and number of migrations, for platforms composed of four and eight processors. We compare the performance of these semi-partitioned heuristics with the performance of classical partitioned scheduling algorithms and with a global scheduling heuristic which is currently considered to have good performances.",

    "abstract_s":"Nanostructured Sm-Fe-Mo semi-hard magnetic material exhibiting enhanced magnetic properties can be pro-duced by ball milling followed by recrystallization. Milled samples were annealed for 30 min in a vacuum at different temperatures (T A) between 700 and 1190 • C. The effects of heat treatment and Mo content on struc-tural and magnetic property changes have been investigated by means of x-ray diffraction using the Rietveld method, transmission electron microscopy and magnetic measurements. For samples annealed at T A > 900 • C the tetragonal ThMn 12 -type structure is identified, while for 700 < T A <900 • C a new out of equilibrium P 6\/mmm type structure was found as the major phase. This novel nanocrystalline phase has never been synthesized before. The correspondent stoichiometry is determined on the basis of the vacancy model. The Rietveld analysis gives a stoichiometry ratio equal to 1:10, for the out of equilibrium hexagonal phase, which is described with three crystallographic transition metal sites: 3g is fully occupied, 6l occupation is limited to hexagons surrounding the Fe dumbbell pairs 2e. We have performed a magnetic and structural study of nanocrystalline metastable P 6\/mmm Sm(Fe 1−x Mo x) 10 , correlated to structural transformation towards its equilibrium derivative I4\/mmm Sm(Fe 1−x Mo x) 12 . A maximum of the coercive field H C (H C > 5 kOe) has been observed for the new hexagonal P 6\/mmm phase suggesting that nanocrystalline Sm(Fe,Mo) 10 , is a semi-hard material, and is potential candidate for magnetic recording.",

    "abstract_s":"Numerical methods motivated by rapid advances in image processing techniques have been intensively developed during recent years and increasingly applied to simulate heterogeneous materials with complex microstructure. The present work aims at elaborating an incremental–iterative numerical method for voxel-based modeling of damage evolution in quasi-brittle microstructures. The iterative scheme based on the Lippmann–Schwinger equation in the real space domain (Yvonnet, in Int J Numer Methods Eng 92:178–205, 2012) is first cast into an incremental form so as to implement nonlinear material models efficiently. In the proposed scheme, local strain increments at material grid points are computed iteratively by a mapping operation through a transformation array, while local stresses are determined using a constitutive model that accounts for material degradation by damage. For validation, benchmark studies and numerical simulations using microtomographic data of concrete are performed. For each test, numerical predictions by the incremental–iterative scheme and the finite element method, respectively, are presented and compared for both global responses and local damage distributions. It is emphasized that the proposed incremental–iterative formulation can be straightforwardly applied in the framework of other Lippmann–Schwinger equation-based schemes, like the fast Fourier transform method.",

    "title_s":"All motivated by public service? The links between hierarchical position and public service motivation",
    "abstract_s":"Research into public service motivation is currently witnessing exponential growth. However, the universal application of the concept to all categories of public employees raises questions. Indeed, the origins of the concept, which can be traced back to political science studies in the United States, may suggest that the concept applies mainly to senior management but much less to operatives of various types, whose motivations seem more instrumental . Research into the antecedents of PSM has thus shown that high hierarchical levels were associated with employee profiles with a high level of PSM (Bright, 2005; Camilleri, 2007). Some authors go as far as to consider that the concept does not apply at all to operative jobs (Gabris and Simo, 1995). The purpose of this article is therefore to analyse the differences between the public service motivation of operatives and that of other categories of employees. To do so, we draw on two empirical studies, one quantitative (n = 2 868), conducted among the public employees of cities in 12 countries, and the other qualitative, conducted among public employees working in the technical service of a French town. Our results show that the level of PSM is not lower among operatives but that, on the other hand, it is different in its nature and dimensions. Notes to practitioners The issue of the PSM of operative public employees takes on a managerial dimension. Indeed, it has potential policy implications for human resource management policies to be implemented and on the segmentation of the public employees in the light of these policies. Our results thus argue for the mainstreaming of the public service dimension in the management of executives and would suggest that it is in the interest of public organisations to encourage the public service motivation of their employees by designing tasks in such a way that public employees can better appreciate the result of their work among customers and users.",

    "abstract_s":"This paper aims to present the state of the art of a rising French research community on knowledge management, who organized during the past four years, a French speaking congress (GeCSO). Interests in knowledge management (KM) come from various disciplines: economy, social, engineering. These interests are not often linked. Within the firms, KM practices vary a lot depending on national cultures and on activity sectors. However, one can identify a potential symmetry between the diversity of practices and the partitioning of scientific approaches. Design\/methodology\/approach – In order to synthesize the different approaches in KM, the authors studied the 62 papers published in the first three conferences. To have a first representation of the diversity, they analyzed the keywords that were used: among 173 keywords used by the authors, eight keywords represent 27 per cent of the total amount. Findings – Three main dimensions which emerged from the articles are analysed: the practical dimension, the epistemological point of view, and the intention to define a theory of action. Originality\/value – KM is an emerging domain, especially in French culture. This paper can be seen as a first foundation of the domain, and also a manifesto to develop interdisciplinary research on this topic.",

    "abstract_s":"Objectives: An important barrier to electronic healthcare information exchanges (HIE) is the lack of interoperability between information systems especially on the semantic level. In the scope of the ANR (Agence Nationale pour la Recherche)\/TeRSan (Terminology and Data Elements Repositories for Healthcare Interoperability) project, we propose to set and use a semantic interoperability platform, based on semantic web technologies, in order to facilitate standardized healthcare information exchanges between heterogeneous Electronic Healthcare Records (EHRs) in different care settings. Material and methods: The platform is a standard-based expressive and scalable semantic interoperability framework. It includes centrally managed Common Data Elements bounded to international\/national reference terminologies such as ICD10, CCAM, SNOMED CT, ICD-O, LOINC and PathLex. It offers semantic services such as dynamic mappings between reference and local terminologies. Results: A pilot implementation of semantic services was developed and evaluated within an HIE prototype in telepathology for remote expert advice. The semantic services developed for transcoding local terms into reference terms take into account the type of message and the exchange context defined within standard-based integration profiles. Conclusion: The TeRSan platform is an innovative semantic interoperability framework that (1) provides standard-based semantic services applicable to any HIE infrastructure and (2) preserves the use of local terminologies and local models by end users (health professionals' priority).",

    "abstract_s":"Recently, a growing interest has emerged for examining the potential of Image Processing tools to assist Art Investigation. Simultaneously, several research works showed the interest of using multifractal analysis for the description of homogeneous textures in images. In this context, the goal of the present contribution is to study the benefits of using the wavelet leader based multifractal formalism to characterize paintings. After a brief review of the underlying key theoretical concepts, methods and tools, two sets of digitized paintings are analyzed. The first one, the Princeton Experiment, consists of a set of seven paintings and their replicas, made by the same artist. It enables examination of the potential of multifractal analysis in forgery detection. The second one is composed of paintings by Van Gogh and contemporaries, made available by the Van Gogh and Kroller- Muller Museums (Netherlands) in the framework of the ¨ Image processing for Art Investigation research program. It enables us to show various differences in the regularity of textures of Van Gogh’s paintings from different periods, or between Van Gogh’s and contemporaries’ paintings. These preliminary results plead for the constitution of interdisciplinary research teams consisting of experts in art, image processing, mathematics and computer sciences.",

It argues that in order to grasp national cultures and discover team members' sense -making systems, it is necessary to understand the extent to which the actors diverge or converge in managing collective action. Based on the members'national and professional profiles, institutional contexts and interaction modes as well as their differences in goals, Chevrier proposes 5 types of intercultural teams: strategic coordination teams, mixed operational teams, project teams, professional teams and quasi-homogenous teams. The author also maintains that cross-cultural management may be derived from the general processes of coordination which can be classifed under two categories - interpersonal coordination and interpersonal coordination. The first category includes mutual adjustment and direct supervision. The second category encompasses the standardization of processes, results and values (through organizational ideology) and skills The configurational framework delineates how each type of team can use different cross-cultural management modes to enhance its effectiveness.",

The study draws on a theoretical framework based on the literature on customer involvement in service co-production, on deviant customer behavior management, and on the general typology of organizational modes of control proposed by Chiapello (1996). Three co-production models related to three control patterns of consumer behavior are identified. First, the transactional model of industrial co-production is associated with strong, highly instrumented control exercised by the organization. Second, the model of relational co-production is associated with control by the market and delegation to consumers. Third, the model of community co-production is associated with strong control based on the community itself. The paper concludes by discussing the strong links that may exist between co-production systems, control systems and business models for each of the companies studied.",

Second, the composition of governance bodies has been examined. In AdM, tensions occur among colleges and involve employees and volunteers. In Websourd, conflicts emerge within the employees' college and focus on ambiguity regarding roles between, on one the hand, employees and managers and, on the other, between deaf and hearing people. Finally, concerning governing bodies's operations, a power imbalance among their stakeholders has been noticed. In both organizations, expertise and skills are seen as essential, and members with the most power are conferred the greatest legitimacy.",

Extending Mary Douglas’s work, this article investigates tidiness from the angle of symbolic pollution. Based on photo-elicitation, it shows that, similarly to symbolic pollution described at a macro-social level, tidiness depends on two conditions, namely, a set of classifications and the dangerous transgression of these classifications. However, at a micro-social level, individuals negotiate boundaries between classifications in order to cope with symbolic pollution. Consumers define their domestic classifications through a juxtaposition of micro-practices, which does not necessarily create a hierarchically ordered system but which enables these consumers to avoid anomalies and transgressions. Furthermore, respondents are willing to break tidiness rules on specific occasions because the danger-beliefs associated with transgression are context-dependent. This analysis of tidiness gives new insights into materiality, emphasizing the cultural meaning of ordering one’s possessions.",

    "abstract_s":"The case presented here shows how a set of Lacanian concepts can be useful for analysing the behaviour of the employees' representatives in a factory belonging to a large globalized and financialised corporation and threatened with closure. We identify a central characteristic of this organization (the obliteration of symbolic authority) to identify the psychic processes the employees' representatives go through as a result of this characteristic and the impact in terms of their difficulties in exerting resistance. We rest our analysis on the distinction Lacan makes between utterance and enunciation and make use of the concepts of master signifier, symbolic authority, fantasy and superego. We show that in this case the absence of symbolic authority leads the staff representatives to be taken over by the fantasy of a tyrannical and unbarred Other that has the absolute power to close down the factory at any time, and to feel guilty that they never do enough, a typical sense of guilt resulting from the superego's unfulfillable demands. This theory is also relevant for understanding the paradoxes of resistance: the staff representatives will need to reintroduce a symbolic authority so as to be able to start resisting and no longer be overwhelmed by the fantasy of an unbarred Other. We emphasize the benefits of using a Lacanian approach for understanding how discursive, psychic and emotional processes are joined in the power relations characteristic of a global capitalist corporation, and reflect on the structural conditions in which resistance is possible in contemporary organizations.",

    "abstract_s":"Purpose – Eliminating overpackaging is a central question in sustainable development, and poses a dilemma for retailers. Since packaging is a differentiation tool for private labels, eliminating it could limit the capacity to give those labels an equivalent image to national brands just as much as it could be a sustainable development opportunity and a positioning instrument. Drawing on the attribution theory framework, this article examines how eliminating overpackaging influences consumers’ perception of products sold under generic and mimic private labels, and their purchase intention. Methodology – This research uses a 2 (overpackaging: present vs. absent) x 2 (brand concept: generic vs. mimic private label) between-subjects experiment on a convenience sample of 217 French consumers. The conceptual framework was tested using ANCOVA and mediation analyses. Findings – Our experiment shows that eliminating overpackaging does have an influence on mimic private labels’ image, particularly on perceived quality, convenience and environmental friendliness. We also find that this influence negatively transfers to purchase intention for mimic private labels through lower perceived quality and convenience. No such effect appears for generic private labels’ image. Value – This study addresses an issue as yet unexplored in marketing – the effect of overpackaging on private label products – and proposes areas for managerial and societal reflection relevant to retail chains interested in eliminating overpackaging.",

First, it describes the discursive practices through which team leaders and forecasters co-perform distributed leadership. Second, it shows that while facing relatively similar natural, technological, task-related and human conditions, leaders co-construct two different forms of distributed leadership: coordinated distribution (Spillane, or sequential, Thompson, 1967) and collaborated distribution (or reciprocal). Finally, it underlines that different leadership configurations may result in similar, favorable outcomes, thereby inviting us to take distance with a determinist concept of leadership.",

The uncertainty and ambiguity that characterize situations of change in organizations make questions of organizational justice a particulary touchy subject matter. Members of the organization want to understand and make sense of organizational change. How individuals form their judgment of justice when confronted with an organizational change? Which process of sensemaking does it involve ? We propose here to examine the process through which members of the organization during organizational change form their judgment of justice considering that this process is akin to a process of sensemaking. (Weick, 1995). Our contribution is twofold: first we summarize the contributions of theories and research on justice and emphasize that they do not account for the social processes through which justice judgments are formed in organizations. Building on the works of sensemaking in organisations (Weick, 1995; Balogun & Johnson, 2004; 2005), we propose an exploratory model of formation of justice judgments that emphasizes three fundamental aspects of the life of organizations undergoing change: uncertainty, ambiguity and the role of social interactions.",

    "abstract_s":"The objective of this thesis is to create new nanostructured surfaces with bioactive coatings and to study theirs physicochemical properties in order to develop better dental implants designs and promote their osseointegration. This functionalization was performed in two steps; starting by the nanostructuration of TiO2 surface by anodisation to create reactive sites on the edges of titanium nanotubes which acts as points of “attachment\" to bioactive coatings. The second step was the surface chemical modification by coating the nanostructured surface with bioactive coatings of calcium phosphate (CaP) and strontium doped calcium phosphate (Sr.CaP). This coating was performed by pulsed electrodeposition. The physicochemical characterization by XPS, SEM and IR showed that doping with Sr promotes a non-apatitic compound similar to DCPD or DCPA (Dicalcium Phosphate Dihydrate or Anhydrous), while undoped CaP coating looks like an amorphous apatite-like compound ACP. The addition of strontium has the double advantage of optimizing the cellular multiplication and of giving an inorganic phase with bio-performance better than apatitic compounds. We also evaluated the adsorption proprieties of these functionalized surfaces by investigating the adsorption of proteins (BSA). This adsorption was performed onto tblank nanotubes, nanotubes coated with CaP and Sr doped CaP and evaluated according to deposition time and to the pH value of the solution that affect both protein and surface charge. The kinetic and structural evaluation reveals different adsorption geometries according to pH and adsorption time and also according to the chemical nature of surface. Such results of protein adsorption and conformation may form a database to understand and control protein activities and reactions with living body when used for dental implants system",

Commitment is a major ingredient for building collaborative business relationships. However, it is generally studied 1) in a static way, not in a dynamic approach, 2) in a unilateral perspective, not in a dyadic approach 3) rarely in international contexts. Our processual analysis uses a retrospective and real time longitudinal study of a long-term French-Japanese business relationship. The data is collected on both sides of the dyad and consists of triangulating from in-depth interviews, archives and field notes. The main findings show that commitment dimensions follow a complex dynamic process. They are culturally-bound, often unconscious, implicit and therefore not necessarily perceived by the other party or attributed a different meaning. Managers can therefore decide to make some commitment evidences more explicit and understand how these are perceived by their foreign partners.",

Reading this book, one is immersed in a thorough and original piece of work showing in different cultural working contexts, how relative the meaning of certain values can be: in this instance, corporate values. Such values are not necessarily the same things for different people – nor are they seen the same way. The author, Philippe d’Iribarne, looks at the way a set of corporate values is diffused within a multinational company. D’Iribarne is able to detail how these values materialize in the employees’ daily practices in several subsidiaries, thanks to in-depth investigations within the Lafarge group -‘an industrial group with French roots and a humanist tradition’ (Foreword in d’Iribarne, 2012).",

    "abstract_s":"Background Occupying a low socioeconomic position is associated with increased mortality risk. To disentangle this association, previous studies considered various dimensions of socioeconomic trajectories across the life course. However, they used a limited number of stages. We simultaneously examined various dimensions of the whole professional trajectory and its association with mortality. Methods We used a large sample (337?706 men and 275?378 women) of the data obtained by linking individuals? annual occupation (collected in 1976?2002 from a representative panel of the French salaried population in the semipublic and private sectors) with causes of death obtained from registries. All-cause and cause-specific HRs were estimated using Cox's regression models adjusted for the occupational class at the beginning of the follow-up, the current occupational class, the transition rates between occupational categories and the duration of time spent in occupational categories. Results An increase in the time spent in the clerk class increased men and women's cardiovascular mortality risk compared with that in the upper class (HRs=1.59 (1.14 to 2.20) and 2.65 (1.14 to 6.13) for 10?years increase, respectively, for men and women). Men with a high rate of transitions had about a 1.2-fold increased risk of all-cause and external-cause mortality compared with those without transitions during their professional life. This association was also observed for women's all-cause mortality. Conclusions Strong associations between professional trajectories and mortality from different causes of death were found. Long exposure to lower socioeconomic conditions was associated with increased mortality risk from various causes of death. The results also suggest gradual associations between transition rates and mortality.",

    "title_s":"Optimization of a high temperature solar receiver by polydispersion of particles",
    "abstract_s":"Solar Particle Receivers (SPRs) are promising candidates to work at high temperatures (T > 1100 K) in Central Solar Power (CSP) plants. They will permit the use of high efficient thermodynamic cycles, such as a combined cycle (Brayton cycle + Rankine cycle). Nevertheless, the optimal conditions that reduce the receiver losses (and consequently maximize the receiver efficiency) still remain to be studied. In this work, the principal parameters that drive the receiver efficiency are numerically optimized. For this end, a simplified radiative model is developed, which allows one to run the high number of simulations needed in such optimization. This model consists in a 1D slab of particulate media submitted to a collimated and concentrated solar flux. The medium emits, absorbs and anisotropically scatters energy. A two-stream method with a delta-Eddington approximation is implemented to fast solve the radiative transfer equation. Among the several two-stream approximations, the one proposed by Joseph et al. (1976) is chosen due to its good treatment of the anisotropic scattering. The volume optical properties are computed under the independent scattering hypothesis, the single-particle optical properties with the Lorenz-Mie theory and the phase function with the Henyey-Greenstein phase function. Such a model is used with a Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm to find the optimal particle size, volume fraction and complex refractive index to be used in the receiver. Once the ideal optimal conditions for a SPR are found, the replication of these results is attempted by using real materials. Six materials (HfB2, ZrB2, HfC, ZrC, W and SiC) are chosen because of their spectral selective behavior or their high absorptivity. At this stage, an important difficulty is the lack of information about the refractive indexes of materials. Therefore, the Kramers-Kronig dispersion relations are utilized to find the refractive indexes from reflectance data. Then, three SPR configurations are considered: (1) a homogeneous medium with only one kind of particles, (2) a medium with a mixture of two materials and, (3) a homogeneous medium with coated particles. The three configuration results are compared with those obtained using particles made of an ideal material. A remarkable result is obtained when W-particles coated with SiC are used. This configuration decreases the radiative losses approaching to the ideal minimal. Finally, the influence of the fluid flow on the radiative losses is studied through the implementation of a convection-radiation heat transfer model. A simple geometry is adopted for a gas-particles mixture flow between two parallel plates, where one of them is a window. The concentrated solar radiation then affects perpendicularly the fluid flow. The energy equation is solved using a low-Mach approximation and the divergence of the radiative flux with the radiative model developed before. A parametric study is conducted to investigate the influence of the optical properties on the radiative losses. In the future, more materials remain to be investigated to be used in solar particle receivers. To this end, the refractive indexes of a number of materials should be measured. The developed codes will be useful for this investigation",

    "title_s":"The London Stock Exchange: Strategic Corporate Governance Restructuring After Demutualization",
    "abstract_s":"This study uses the London Stock Exchange (LSE), forced to demutualize due to major changes in its business environment, notably due to increased competition and technological advances, as field experiment to study corporate governance restructuring to adapt to new market conditions. The LSE improved its financial situation after demutualization and is an example of successful corporate governance restructuring. The LSE significantly restructured the composition of its board of directors following demutualization. The number of exchange members on the LSE board decreased after demutualization while the number of independent directors increased, pointing to a more “monitoring board”, in support of an agency theory approach. Interestingly, the large majority of these independent directors had experiences in diverse business. The LSE significantly reorganized its management team to adapt to the new strategies triggered by demutualization and modified its compensation by increasing performance-related payments. Results suggest that demutualization brings efficiencies if accompanied by changes in the governing bodies and in the incentive structures of the exchanges. Most of our results could be relevant also, for example, for firms going public, for smaller firms that are expanding their activities and searching for outside investors and for companies facing major changes in their business environments.",

    "title_s":"Stock exchange consolidation and return volatility",
    "abstract_s":"Purpose – In recent years, stock exchanges have been increasingly integrating and merging their activities at a national and international scale. While consolidation is often driven by technological, legal and competitive changes, whether merger activities are efficient in terms of market microstructure remains unknown. Academic research to date has analyzed the causes behind these mergers primarily from the technological, legal and competitive perspective, whereas relatively little literature considers their impact on the exchange itself. The paper aims to consider the case of the Euronext merger to explain this topic by studying this merger and its effect on Euronext's market risk (measured by volatility). Design\/methodology\/approach – The paper uses a standard General Auto‐regressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH (1,1)) process to study the volatility of the underlying markets and use break methodology to highlight the merger effects. It also adds control samples to account for any change in volatility that could be caused by factors other than the merger event. Findings – The results suggest that the Euronext merger did not affect the market risk. In particular, the paper finds no evidence that the integration onto the same platforms for trading and clearing had a significant effect on the volatility of the merging markets. Practical implications – This study contributes to clarify business issues and to guide policy makers on exchange industrial organization. Originality\/value – The present paper further contributes to the ongoing discussion about the drawbacks and merits of horizontal exchange integration.",

    "abstract_s":"Interpretive content analysis can be used to unveil cultural frames of meaning of actors from different cultural backgrounds working in dispersed teams. When working at a distance, team members are often unaware that they do not give the same meaning to most basic management processes they are concerned with. This presentation will illustrate how qualitative research can provide insights about what decision-making or empowerment mean for employees from different countries. For instance measuring the power relationship index of a country induces managers to delegate more or less to employees. With qualitative understanding of what empowerment and decision-making mean, the question is no longer to know to what extent leaders should delegate but to find the specific conditions of delegation in various countries. This cultural understanding helps people to design management processes matching the requirements of partners from different cultures.",

It reveals their motivations in relation to this new kind of retailing in the luxury sector, and the advantages of new technologies for meeting the growing demands of a clientele eager for new purchase experiences. We show that pop-up luxury stores add new features to the traditional luxury sector: informality, friendliness, ludicity and accessibility in the context of shared emotions. The key results from this study reveal that the commercial activities of pop-up stores complement those of their luxury parent Houses, in that they contribute emotionality and playfulness, while at the same nourishing the brand's mythical aspect.",

Design\/methodology\/approach – Data on 12 directors of family‐run SME were grouped together on the basis of questions derived from the research question. To do this, the authors operated using a principle guided by cross referencing responses, that is, finding the incidence of elements that make it possible to justify substantively the existence of the category and the common existence of these elements within the cases studied. Findings – The thematic analysis performed made it possible to highlight five main motives for cultural and psychological resistance in former directors: the loss of power and influence, the risk of deconstruction, the loss of professional and social legitimacy, the loss of references and meaning, and the refusal of old age and death. Originality\/value – The results show that transferors search for connections in the aim of identifying common points of anchor, affinities on to which they can project themselves as an element of continuity or an extension of their personality. The paper can in particular note the importance given to cultural proximity and to previous professional relations with the transferor. These criteria, unlike personal factors, are of the interpersonal type and thus deeply imprinted on the transferor's most intimate desires and motivations, including the main desire, which is to search for all that can make possible an extension of himself within his company and thus ensure the permanence of his values and his time at the organisation.",

    "abstract_s":"The reforms which French hospitals have undergone over the last two decades have radically modified their methods of functioning. Hospitals have been asked to modernise in a context of increased constraints and a multiplication of management tools. These changes in the (French) health system bring into question the change capacity of these organisations. We look at the role of organisational routines in the change dynamics of hospitals. Could such routines be a resource for change? Under which conditions? In order to answer these questions we analyse the evolution of absence management organisational routines in two departments of a French hospital – the Emergency Department (ED) and a Nursing Home. Our results show that a balance between the two aspect of a routine, the ostensive, the mental representation of the routine, and the performative, the implementation of the routine, (Feldman, 2000), favours the evolution of the routine and reinforces the change dynamics of the hospital department. Conversely, when the ostensive aspects are weak, the actors are incapable of going beyond the rules and the evolution process of the organisational routine gets blocked. In this situation of imbalance the dynamic of organisational change is itself hampered.",

    "abstract_s":"Many blockstreams occur in the Miocene volcanic area of Mont Mézenc, eastern Velay, SE Massif Central, France. They were supplied by frost-shattered exposures of lava-flow boundaries, phonolitic domes and other intrusions. These ‘rivers of rock’ are ribbons of chaotically upheaved blocks presenting an openwork structure, are 400 to 1100 m long and 20 to 200 m wide, and are today disconnected from the rock exposures that supplied the debris. Some occur on very low gradient slopes. The largest blockstreams offer evidence of compression ridges and post-depositional block subsidence. Their dynamics and age are not precisely known in the study area and they have been interpreted by default as Late Pleniglacial rock glaciers. Field observations (stratigraphic relations with other surficial deposits, topographic position, distance from bedrock source areas and from talwegs, structural context), however, indicate that the situation is more complex, with new implications for their age, origin and past dynamics. This reconnaissance study proposes a typology of blockstreams for the area. The base of the blockstreams remains inaccessible to direct observation but several ground-penetrating radar transects were carried out in order to map the topography at depth. Results show that the blocks fill gullies 5 to 15 m in depth. At the surface, a sharp textural transition with other slope deposits is clearly detected but the latter grade topographically to the surface of the blockstreams, not to the gullies beneath them. These cross-cutting relations provide a relative chronology not previously established in the case of blockstream deposits.",

    "abstract_s":"La province volcanique du Velay oriental (SE du Massif central) compte une forte concentration de pierriers d’origine et d’appellation diverses (éboulis, chirats), issus du démantèlement des affleurements rocheux (rebords de coulées et, surtout, dômes et intrusions phonolitiques). Parmi ces accumulations figurent les « rivières de pierres » ou blockstreams de la littérature anglophone. Il s’agit de langues de blocs métriques redressés en tous sens, sans matrice en surface, déconnectées des amonts pourvoyeurs (gélifraction) et présentes jusque sur des pentes très faibles. Elles ont souvent été assimilées par défaut à d'anciens glaciers rocheux et rattachées sur la base d’arguments morpho-stratigraphiques au Pléniglaciaire supérieur. Elles sont en fait d’origine et d’âge mal connu et ne répondent pas clairement au modèle classique d’un glacier rocheux de haute montagne. Les observations de terrain (caractères intrinsèques, rapports stratigraphiques avec les autres formations, position dans la topographie, distance aux zones-source, contexte structural...), suggèrent des processus de mise en place par fluage et\/ou lavage qui restent à préciser, la possibilité d’une chenalisation des blocs par la topographie préexistante (ravines), et posent la question de l’âge, de l’efficacité des processus en jeu et de l’existence éventuelle de plusieurs générations. L’acquisition récente de photographies aériennes traitées en photogrammétrie (orthophotographies, MNT) doit permettre de préciser la description de l’organisation de surface (modelé, fabrique) révélatrice des contraintes liées aux processus de mise en place. D'autre part, les investigations géophysiques menées (GPR et tomographie électrique) pourraient apporter d'intéressants éléments de compréhension. Cette étude s’intègre au programme de recherche WRACC, financé par L’Etablissement Public Loire et le FEDER.",

    "abstract_s":"—Collaboration between nodes in Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) is very important for the proper functioning of the network. This is an assumption that has to be fulfilled in the design of routing protocols. However, this is not always true since some nodes could misbehave in order to have some benefits or simply avoid wasting resources. In this paper we question this assumption that does not take into consideration the bad behavior of nodes involved in the routing protocols. We analyze the characteristics of the existing solutions, and we propose a reputation-based mechanism that isolates selfish nodes based on control packets generated as a result to nodes' observations on the behavior of other nodes. We propose a mathematical framework to increase\/decrease the reputation of a node depending on the situation and the observation condition. We show via simulation that our solution achieve remarkable improvements in the delivery rate of packets, more than satisfying results concerning false positive and false negative, and it shows that the overhead caused by our system is negligible.",

This research addresses the main paradoxes of IE theories: a deterministic vs free agent point of view; an individual hero vs a collective action approach; and a change vs reproduction perspective. Design\/methodology\/approach – A case study of the role of an IE in the building of the OD field in Europe conducted through interviews with the main actors and in-depth documentary research. Findings – The case highlights the IE resources as products of a dynamic historical process driven by values; the process of building the field as an interaction between framing issues, mobilizing agents and resources, transforming a policy window into a political opportunity. It relativizes the IE role: an indispensable catalyst of collective action that can also reinforce the hegemonic bloc while changing the rules. Originality\/value – The paper highlights the necessity of longitudinal analysis to address the agent\/structure paradox.",

France – a country whose own cuisine is world-renowned, yet which regularly ranks couscous as one of its top three favorite national dishes, and which hosts the largest North African population in Europe – seemed a fertile site for an investigation of the polysemic meanings attached to couscous, a nomad product embedded in socio-historical interrelationships on both shores of the Mediterranean. We found that consumers appropriate and adapt the product in ways that demonstrate some of the major features of Mediterranean relationships, with food as a vehicle for creative personal narratives. We emphasize the diversity of representations of couscous that help dissolve the usual northern\/southern Mediterranean binaries in order to achieve a complex understanding of Mediterranean consumer behaviors.",

    "abstract_s":"Le développement durable est aujourd'hui introduit dans les discours comme un modèle alternatif et légitime pour répondre à un problème majeur de notre époque contemporaine : il est urgent de combiner à la fois le développement économique et le respect des ressources naturelles, des droits sociaux et de l'équité dans la répartition de la richesse créée. Dans ce contexte, la responsabilité des acteurs du marché s'élargit au périmètre défini par le rapport Brundtland (1987). Ce dernier questionne les modalités de fonctionnement des entreprises et interpelle les théories en marketing notamment la notion d'échange entre l'entreprise et son marché, y compris ses parties prenantes. Pour autant, les moyens de la mise en oeuvre du développement durable par le marketing sont encore à préciser et à crédibiliser (Gabriel, 2003), même si de nombreuses expériences illustrent l'émergence de nouvelles pratiques et innovations marketing. Quant à la recherche, elle se déploie désormais, dans une visée performative ou transformative, les actions des organisations souhaitant répondre aux enjeux du développement durable (Trinquecoste, 2013). A ce titre, le marketing peut sortir par le haut (Volle, 2013) en pensant le temps long de l'action des entreprises (Pras, 2013). Mais le marketing ne se pense seulement au niveau des organisations : les consommateurs sont à la fois des vecteurs et des acteurs de la performance des politiques mises en oeuvre par les entreprises. Ils peuvent aussi être les promoteurs de nouvelles orientations en marché (Callon et Muniesa, 2003 ; Martin et Schouten, 2014). Dans cette mouvance, nous avons fait un appel à contributions, il y a déjà deux ans, pour dévoiler les transformations à l'oeuvre dans les marchés et dans les techniques de marketing en relation avec le développement durable : d'une part, pour mieux saisir la mise en oeuvre",

Due to their low resources, sensors come along with new issues regarding network security and energy consumption. Focusing on the network availability, previous studies proposed to protect the network against denial of service attacks with the use of traffic monitoring agents. Working on the election process, we try to enhance this solution by introducing an energy-aware and secure method to dynamically select these “cNodes” in a clustered WSN: nodes with the higher residual energy get elected. We discuss limitations of this deterministic selection and suggest to designate new control nodes, “vNodes”, to monitor the cNodes by periodically enquiring about their remaining energy, thus ensuring that they do not lie during the election process in attempt to keep their role. Validation is first carried out with a formal specification of our proposal using the UPPAAL model-checker. We model nodes by means of communicating timed automata, logical clocks and timing constraints. Through Computation Tree Logic we express and check properties for the election processes, related to energy and presence of greedy or jamming nodes.",

The deployment of such a network is accompanied by several security issues, including data confidentiality. Robust encryption algorithms addressed to network communication exist, but they do not always match the low resources restrictions — low processor, memory, limited energy — set upon the sensors. To overcome this, other, simpler solutions have been proposed, such as the Securing Data based on Multi-Path routing method, or an application of the Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme, which both use distinct paths in the network to send pieces of data obtained by splitting the original message. This paper addresses the two methods named above, and proposes a solution based on traffic classification, using alternatively the Securing Data based on Multi-Path routing method, the Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme, and strong encryption algorithms.",

These algorithms are particularly useful in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), where they allow data aggregation and energy cuts. By forming clusters and electing cluster heads responsible for forwarding their packets, the small devices that compose WSNs have not to reach directly the base station (BS) of the network. They spare energy and they can lead further in time their measuring task, so as to detect forest fires or water pollution for example. In this paper, we will apply a new and general clustering algorithm, based on classificability and ultrametric properties, to a WSN.

Selenium content was lower in plants supplemented with selenate and accumulated mainly in the leaves compared with selenite-treated plants where the selenium was retained in the roots. Selenite-treated grains accumulated more selenium. Selenate was metabolized less than selenite in whole plants, but in grains selenium was present exclusively as organic selenium compounds. For humans, the bioavailability of organic selenium was evaluated at 90% compared with only 50% for inorganic forms.

In particular, it aims at understanding how tools not only reconfigure relations in organizations, i.e. how people coordinate between each other, but also meaning, i.e. how people interpret the fundamental meaning of their work content and tasks. Design\/methodology\/approach ‐ The paper reports findings from a longitudinal ethnographic study which investigates the writing process of an interactive live performance written by a group of non-professional writers that was led by French video and multimedia artist Michel Jaffrennou during three months. Findings ‐ The paper shows how multiplying writing software induced the group members to challenge their initial understanding of the cultural and traditional genre of \"theater play\". It provides an empirically based account of the capacity of tools to reconfigure meaning in organizational contexts. Practical implications ‐ The paper provides insights about how tools can be used not only as means to an end, but also as ways in which to build original strategies for exploration, especially during creative group sessions. Originality\/value ‐ The paper sheds light on distinctive albeit poorly studied aspects of tools and ICT within organizations, namely their capacity to reconfigure meaning, which more empirical studies could further investigate.",

The purpose is to reveal the processual nature of the dysfunctional behaviour category and to point out the dilemmas that organizations face when drawing the line between what is acceptable and what is not. Methodology: the article focuses on fare evasion management in urban bus transport, and more specifically on control interactions between ticket inspectors and passengers. Thanks to an ethnographic study of inspection work and to a dramaturgical approach to control interactions, the article accounts for the process of fraud enactment. Findings: the article gives insight into a specialized service related activity: frontline inspection. It shows how different types of fare evasion behaviours are identified, qualified and eventually enacted. In addition, it points out three types of dilemmas in deviant behaviour management: service \/ sanction; offense focused perspective \/ dysfunctional behaviour management perspective and control outcome effectiveness \/ control outcome visibility. Research limitations \/ implications: further research is needed to generalize the results. Moreover this original enactment perspective may not be restricted to service encounters, and future research work should address other aspects of the dysfunctional behaviour enactment process. Practical implications: Originality: the paper contributes to the theory of deviant client’s behaviours and brings a processual and social-constructive perspective.",

Since the mid 70's, this numerical approach is widely used to understand the spatial variation of natural phenomena in various domains like Oil and Gas, Mining or Environmental Industries. Considering the huge amount of data available, standard implementations of these numerical methods are not efficient enough to tackle current challenges in geosciences. Moreover, most of the software packages available for geostatisticians are designed for a usage on a desktop computer due to the trial and error procedure used during the interpolation. The Geological Data Management (GDM) software package developed by the French geological survey (BRGM) is widely used to build reliable three-dimensional geological models that require a large amount of memory and computing resources. Considering the most time-consuming phase of kriging methodology, we introduce an efficient out-of-core algorithm that fully benefits from graphics cards acceleration on desktop computer. This way we are able to accelerate kriging on GPU with data 4 times bigger than a classical in-core GPU algorithm, with a limited loss of performances.",

The aim here is to analyze the extent to which a corporate social responsibility strategy impacts the management control systems of multinational companies. After a review of the literature and an exploratory study, a conceptual framework was developed, leading us to the idea that social management control systems are directly linked to the ideals, discourses, and programs of sustainable development and corporate social responsibility. Two detailed multi-site case studies were then completed. These case studies revealed that developing social management control systems are in conflict with the still predominant financial control systems. Social management control systems integrate stakeholders into their routines, reinforce internal cohesion, and progressively create the accountable manager whose attention focuses on the long term. This outcome brings enrichment to corporate social responsibility theory by showing that it is managerial and that the corporation and its stakeholders are necessarily linked for the construction of a sustainable development project.",

We consider five different institutional factors and distinguish two categories of measures: country’s quality of legal institutions and laws protecting shareholder rights. Our results show that firms from countries with better institutional environment are more likely to engage in CSR activities, supporting both the prominent role of institutional environment in explaining CSP variation across firms and the CSR-value enhancing view. Moreover, both country’s quality of legal institutions and laws protecting shareholders rights explain scores on four domains: Environment, Corporate Governance, Human Resources and Human Rights. However, Business Behavior domain is only related to an indicator measuring laws protecting shareholders rights. Community Involvement is related to the quality of legal institutions in the country. Finally, we show that CSP is negatively affected by leverage and positively affected by firm size. However, CSP is not related to firm profitability.",

    "abstract_s":"Current debates in design question the effects of \" fixation. \" On the one hand, to be creative, designers should avoid fixing the meaning of objects or proposals, On the other hand, positive effects of fixation have also been observed in various design practices. For instance, \" early fixation \" or \" early crystallization \" have been conceptualized as ways that significantly help starting the design work without limiting its creative potential. To understand these contrasting positions, we take a semiotic perspective on the phenomenon of fixation. Peirce's triadic model of sign (representamen, object, interpretant), defines meaning making as an infinite process through the \" interpretant \" based on personal and social experience. Fixation is therefore a basic semiotic condition through which human beings make sense of the world. As pointed by Peirce, the \" final \" interpretant is the way by which we can actually communicate meaning to further expand it. Following on this model and the Peircean categories (firstness, secondness, thirdness) we identify three different ways in design that structure how meaning making can be stabilized, e.g.: the feeling of some potential (firstness); the combination of events or things (secondness); the establishment of a belief, habit or law (thirdness).",

    "title_s":"The Role of Collective Action in the Pace of Deinstitutionalization: the Case of Asbestos",
    "abstract_s":"This paper attempts to understand why the deinstitutionalisation of asbestos in France has taken so long, despite the fact industrials have known it to be a lethal substance since 1906. The use of asbestos for such a prolonged period has caused thousands of deaths and still continues to kill today. Asbestos is a natural fibre that was already known to the Ancient Greeks and popularized in the 19th century during the Industrial Revolution. By the mid 20th century, asbestos, considered as “a magic mineral” could be found almost everywhere, in concrete, roofing, pipe insulation, clothes and even in cigarettes. Its decline began in the 1980s and its use was eventually banned in 1997 after a series of court cases. As a theoretical contribution, we explain the role of the actions of individuals in collectively overthrowing an institutional order. Most actions are not in vain, and may contribute to a slight change that will eventually lead to the collapse of an institution. Deinstitutionalisation is viewed as a cumulative process, not as a disruption essentially provoked by a jolt. Furthermore, we insist on the issue of the aim of individuals when they are engaged in an institutional work. Disruptive or defensive work has unintended consequences that can lead to the destruction or the consolidation of a practice taken for granted. Thus, we shed light on differences between the aim of actors and the impact of their actions on an institutional level. Finally, our study relies on a process method. It allows us to contribute to Dorado’s model of institutional change (2005). To do that, we compare different periods and we develop the relationship between profiles of institutional change and the solidity of the resulting institutional arrangements on a long term basis.",

    "abstract_s":"Even when accelerated by a jolt, deinstitutionalization is most often a long process constituted by short timestep and long timestep periods. Little has been said however to explain the pace of deinstitutionalization and the factors that may accelerate or slow down this process. Not only strategic actions contribute to deinstitutionalization. Multiple actions are implied and impact on the pace of deinstitutionalization, depending on efforts of maintenance and disruption which may be opposed, isolated or cumulated. Based on Dorado’s model of profiles of actions in institutional change, we draw out some core claims: (1) the pace of deinstitutionalization is all the slower when defensive actions are related to a Leveraging-Strategic actions; (2) The interaction between Leverage-Strategic actions and Accumulating-Sensemaking actions explains the creation of residues that will be later essential to disrupt an institution; (3) The long timestep periods of deinstitutionalization are related to disruptive agency’s tendency to be weakened and scattered, due to a lack of strategic vision from disruptive actors. Finally we present “convening” as an efficient profile of action to considerably slow down a deinstitutionalization process. The argumentation is supported by an historical analysis of the deinstitutionalization of asbestos in France during the 20th century.",

    "title_s":"The Johnnies Onions of Roscoff: the survival of a local anchoring institution.",
    "abstract_s":"Onion Johnnies are seasonal and itinerant sellers from the area of Roscoff in France, organized in company on a specified territory in the United Kingdom, walking and then cycling from door to door to sell their strings of entwisted red onions. Many were called Jean, which gave rise to the \"Johnny\" nickname. The first Onion Johnnies company was supposedly founded by Henri Ollivier, when he first set foot to Plymouth in 1828. Having returned with tales of how quickly and well he had sold his onions, he established a tradition that was to maintain through two centuries. To a British point of view, the Johnnies are peddlers. Even though there has long been a suspicion of dishonest or petty criminal activity associated with peddlers, the Johnnies were considered as respectable and deserving workers.Today, the Johnnies are 70 years old in average but new and young Johnnies become interested in maintaining the tradition. The Johnnies embodie a real institution and the onion is a key element of this institution. For Bartley and Tolbert (1997, p.99), institutions are “historical accretions of past practices and understandings that set conditions on actions”. This definition emphasizes the historical dimension of institutions that draw on past events to constrain present actions. The issue of change in institutional literature has been increasingly studied these last years and has mainly crystallized around the analysis of institutionalization process and the institutional entrepreneur (amongst others: Barley & Tolbert 1997; Holm 1995; Lanzara & Patriotta 2007; Maguire, Hardy & Lawrence 2004; Perkmann & Spicer 2008). Similarly, the temporal effects of institutional mechanisms have been underestimated, and have rarely been systematically analyzed (Lawrence, Winn and Jennings 2001). We assume that institutional work (Lawrence & Suddaby, 2006) is dynamic and inscribed in a momentum. Jansen (2004) distinguishes statis-based momentum and change-based momentum. In both cases, actors’ efforts are inscribed in a specific path and course of actions. Little is known about the role of materiality in this succession of sequences. More specifically, few research study how actors use artefacts and materiality to maintain an institution. Thus the purpose of this research is twofold. First, we can bridge a gap in the literature about the role of materiality in institutional change. Second, this case illustrates how institution has to evolve to be maintained. In this case, boundary organization and materiality leads to the maintenance of an institution promise to the disuse.",

More generally, it looks at patents as a strategic tool that can be used for concluding cooperative R&D agreements (CRDA). The approach begins by looking at the state of the art on the role of technological proximity in CRDAs. This review clearly raises the problem of measuring technological proximity, which needs to be gauged at a two-fold level: general and specific. Then a dual method based on patent portfolios for analyzing the profiles of different potential partners is described along with an example of its application. Concretely, the exploratory study proposed here is based on an analysis of the patent portfolios of 14 French listed biotechnology companies and those of their main R&D partners. The analysis of 5,603 patents filed by the focal firms and their partners shows how the approach can be used to identify compatible partners that are more or less technologically matched.",

Open innovation is a global approach to innovation management analyzed from different angles, such as the technological, human, competition and market aspects. Although various research trends have contributed to understanding open innovation, a key element is missing from the debate: organizational framework as a lever to accompany the implementation of an open innovation model over the long term. This paper therefore aims to fill this gap in research on open innovation by addressing the following research questions: What organizational framework (structure, coordination, etc.) should be put in place to develop an open innovation process? Concretely, in this paper we set out a new approach to managing open innovation: i.e. identifying the organizational framework for integrating outside knowledge. To do this, we focus on organizational set-ups and stakeholders during the early phases of inbound open innovation. We analyse this question on the example of a French group",

    "abstract_s":"Le brevet est un \"titre délivré par l’Etat qui confère à son titulaire un droit exclusif d’exploitation de l’invention qui en est l’objet\" (Chavanne et Burst, 1993, 25). En d’autres termes, il peut être défini comme un avantage concurrentiel accordé à l’inventeur (ou à son ayant droit) qui bénéficie alors du droit exclusif d’exploiter directement ou indirectement son invention (Breesé 2002). En excluant les tiers de l’usage économique de l’invention il permet à l’innovateur de s’approprier la rentre de l’innovation tout en diffusant l’information technologique sur l’invention (Le Bas et Mothe 2010). Rappelons, en effet, que la publication du brevet est la contrepartie de la protection . Le système de brevet a donc été conçu comme un moyen d’inciter à l’innovation en protégeant contre l’imitation tout en favorisant la diffusion des informations techniques. Dans cette approche reposant sur un rôle d’exclusion du brevet, le détenteur en est à la fois l’inventeur, le producteur et le distributeur. Au-delà de cette fonction première d’exclusion, il est aujourd’hui largement reconnu que le brevet n’est pas un simple instrument juridique mais un outil stratégique aux utilisations variées : « comme si le brevet devenait de moins en moins un outil pour protéger l’innovation et de plus en plus un outil pour bloquer l’innovation des firmes rivales » (Le Bas 2002, 4). L’importance des motivations stratégiques conduit à une exploitation plus intensive du brevet (Corbel 2005, Lallement 2008). Les nouveaux déterminants du dépôt n’apparaissent plus uniquement liés à la volonté de maintenir la liberté d’exploitation, mais aussi de mettre la pression sur les firmes rivales, de mieux négocier des droits de propriété industrielle (via des licences notamment), d’instaurer des collaborations, ou de disposer d’un outil juridique dans le cas d’éventuels litiges (Corbel 2011, Le Bas 2002). Le management de l’invention protégée par le brevet s’est donc complexifié. Dans ce contexte, l’objectif de cette recherche est de rendre compte des différents rôles stratégiques attribués au brevet et de montrer comment ils participent à la mise en œuvre d’une stratégie de propriété industrielle (PI) , elle même au cœur de la stratégie générale. L’accent est mis sur la mise en œuvre de ces rôles au cours des différentes étapes de la gestion des brevets. Pour cela, nous nous appuyons sur Danone, leader mondial des produits laitiers frais, dont la stratégie de PI clairement orientée sur le maintien de la position dominante, repose sur l’utilisation combinée de diverses fonctions du brevet.",

    "abstract_s":"The open innovation model (OI) allows high-tech firms to enhance internal R&D capabilities by acquiring knowledge from external sources (inward knowledge flow), as well as to maximize earnings by using external paths to market for internally generated knowledge (outward knowledge flow). To accomplish this, OI firms capitalize on a set of OI practices and specific technology to facilitate the inward and outward flow of knowledge. In this study, we argue that the OI practice dimensions have direct effect on the knowledge flow. Using the media synchronicity theory, we argue that a set of ICT capacities moderate these effects. A causal model to explain the relationships between the variables is proposed.",

In this model firms pay particular attention to the connections between the results of Research and Development (R&D), the technological potential of the external stakeholders and the market of technologies. For these reasons the IP rights and the patent strategy are crucial in the implementation of the open model offering the possibilities for fluent technological exchange. Current studies on Chinese innovation process are in the beginning and the Chinese firms face the question how to use the open model in the global technological competition. In this paper we will examine the implementation of boundaryless innovation model in two Chinese firms. In particular, we focus on the patent strategy relative to the external technological exchanges, the organizational structures established to manage the patents portfolios and the organizational culture as a driving force for opening the innovation process. This analyses leads to perceive how to implement the open model in Chinese firms using the IP rights.",

More generally, the aim is to highlight the role that the SAO analyses can play in identifying R&D partners in open perspective. In the existing literature, a SAO analysis is often considered as a tool for forecasting technological trends. In this research, we overturn this approach considering SAO analysis as a tool for recognizing (a) partner(s) for open innovation management. In doing so, the method, based on SAO analysis, is proposed. Concretely, the originality of this approach consists in first, to build a SAO structure map that illustrates the key technologies and research challenges and second, the key organizations (firms or research institutes) with similar technologies as well the relations between them in order to encourage the open model. The exploratory study is on DSSCs sector.",

With its focus on the cognitive and normative institutional pillars, the existing literature has underestimated the regulative pillar's contribution to institutional change, ignoring part of its role in institutional change. We propose to examine the status conferred on this regulative dimension through a qualitative study of an institutionalised practice, the legal concept of Faute Inexcusable in France from 1898 to 2012. We use secondary data including legal data, contextualised with other sources, and interviews with two key actors in the field. We show the existence of a genuine \" regulative dynamic \" ; beneath its apparent stability, the regulative pillar is in fact the setting for institutional struggles that lead institutionalised practices to evolve. We highlight sequences of institutional work in which various forms of political institutional work interact. This research advances understanding of institutional dynamics in the regulative pillar, casting light on actors and mechanisms that have so far gone unreported. The article thus contributes to a rehabilitation of the regulative pillar's role in neo-institutional theory.",

    "abstract_s":"A new technique is devised to mitigate the errors-in-variables bias in linear regression. The procedure mimics a 2-stage least squares procedure where an auxiliary regression which generates a better behaved predictor variable is derived. The generated variable is then used as a substitute for the error-prone variable in the first-stage model. The performance of the algorithm is tested by simulation and regression analyses. Simulations suggest the algorithm efficiently captures the additive error term used to contaminate the artificial variables. Regressions provide further credit to the simulations as they clearly show that the compact genetic algorithm-based estimate of the true but unobserved regressor yields considerably better results. These conclusions are robust across different sample sizes and different variance structures imposed on both the measurement error and regression disturbances.",

The purpose of this paper is to explore the potential complementarities that could emerge between innovation strategies and sustainable development. Design\/methodology\/approach – As a conceptual paper, this article aims at developing propositions. Findings – Sustainable development constitutes a new data of the macro-environmental context, likely to modify the competing industries and systems in which companies evolve. In return, they represent many opportunities that companies can seize to model their strategies. Within the framework of such an approach, innovation and sustainable development constitute engines of development which can get connected and virtuously feed themselves. Research limitations\/implications – Because of the chosen research approach, the results lack generalisability. Therefore, academics are encouraged to further test the propositions developed in the article. Practical implications – Strategies, and their translation at the organisational level, integrating SD, may provide both a source of competitive advantage for companies and an enhancement of their commitment to society. Social implications – The practices described in the article are aiming at stimulating the innovation of collaborators, in order to integrate the principles of sustainable development within the company.

    "abstract_s":"This paper discussed the notion of value co-creation and the concept of customer competence as suggested by this notion. This led us to consider the competent customer as a social construction related to managerial representations. In order to examine this issue, a longitudinal exploratory research based on participant observation and in-depth interviews with employees of a French energy supplier was conducted to explore whether customers are perceived as competent or incompetent market actors. The data analysis revealed four categories illustrating customers' profiles coping with the new situation of the 'Utility X' group in the energy sector. 'Utility X' employees define their customers according to four profiles: myopic, ignorant, uncreative and organizer of company resources. Even if the marketing studies that share the Service-Dominant Logic point-of-view suggest that the customer would be competent at all times, our findings showed that customer competencies are in fact socially constructed and emerge partially from managerial representations. Therefore, the adoption by companies of a marketing philosophy ('market with' philosophy), in which the customer and supply chain partners are collaborators in the entire marketing process, seems only possible if they recognize customers' competencies and identify situations when customers do not activate their competencies or do not have the resources that enable them to develop their competencies.",

In order to examine the issues related to this emerging concept, the research methodology was divided in two parts. In the first one, we introduced a longitudinal ethnography research (2005-2007) based on participant observation and in-depth interviews with employees in a French business energy supplier called \" Utility X. \" This choice was the best means to understand how do managers in the energy sector consider their customers: are clients represented as active actors or as passive actors within their own consumption experiences. The second part of this research based on in-depth interviews conducted in 2009, involved a group of 10 customers of \" Utility X. \" The objective of these interviews was to emphasize the consumer's activation of his competencies in the energy sector.

As a consequence, the issue has captured the attention of policymakers throughout the world.Several countries are currently adopting or considering the adoption of laws or regulations to promote gender diversity on corporate boards. The purpose of this paper is to compare the effectiveness of using legislative or regulatory means to increase female representation instead of allowing firms to voluntarily fix their own non legally binding targets. We find that the relation between gender diversity and performance is positive in countries using the voluntary approach while it is negative in countries using the regulatory approach. We conclude that public policy aimed at increasing the number of women on corporate boards should be introduced gradually and voluntarily rather than quickly and coercively to avoid sub-optimal board composition.",

    "abstract_s":"The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of gender diversity on the boardroom and on top management positions on earnings management by French-listed firms. Based on a sample of 170 firms over 4 years, we find that the proportion of women on the board standing as a director or a chair reduces earnings management. This finding suggests that women are effective on their monitoring role and are then considered as a crucial corporate governance device. We also find that the relationship between the presence of at least three women on the board and earnings management is negative suggesting that by increasing the number of women on board through regulation and legislation, French firms are likely to enhance the effectiveness of the board to better detect earnings management. However, Women standing in CEO and CFO positions do not affect earnings management practices. These findings suggest that efforts made by political bodies to promote equality between men and women on boards are beneficial for French-listed companies by limiting earnings management practices. However, regulating or imposing a quota of women on boards can create a temporal shortage of qualified women available to take up such positions.",

In these conditions, how can the validation of innovation by the customer from concept definition to the implementation of the evaluation methods be integrated? This article first discusses theoretical works in project management to answer this question for service innovation projects. The basis for the analysis is a series of three case studies of French services firms. It underlines the diversity of solutions used by firms. This preliminary research makes two methodological points. First, it presents different ways of identifying the stages in which these problems can be solved. Second, it clarifies what should be validated at each stage, and which factors determine the methods and the necessary resources to carry them through.",

    "title_s":"Beyond the ocean: Contamination of freshwater ecosystems with (micro-) plastic particles",
    "abstract_s":"Massive accumulation of plastic particles has been reported for marine ecosystems around the world, posing a risk to the biota. Freshwater ecosystems have received less attention despite the majority of plastic litter being produced onshore and introduced into marine environments by rivers. Some studies report not only the presence of microplastics in freshwater ecosystems, but show that contamination is as severe as in the oceans. In continental waters microplastics have been observed in both sediments (predominantly lakeshores but also riverbanks) and water samples (predominantly surface water of lakes and rivers). This review highlights recent findings and discusses open questions, focusing on the methodology of assessing this contaminant in freshwater ecosystems. In this context, method harmonization is needed in order to obtain comparable data from different environmental compartments and sites. This includes sampling strategies (at spatial and temporal 18 scales), sample treatment (taking into consideration high levels of organic matter and suspended 19 solids) and reliable analytical methods to identify microplastics.",

    "abstract_s":"In environmental modelling, estimating the confidence level in conceptual model parameters is necessary but difficult. Having a realistic estimation of the uncertainties related to the parameters is necessary i) to assess the possible origin of the calibration difficulties (correlation between model parameters for instance), and ii) to evaluate the prediction confidence limits of the calibrated model. In this paper, an application of the Metropolis algorithm, a general Monte Carlo Markov chain sampling method, for the calibration of a four-parameter lumped urban stormwater quality model is presented. Unlike traditional optimisation approaches, the Metropolis algorithm identifies not only a \"best parameter set\", but a probability distribution of parameters according to measured data. The studied model includes classical formulations for the pollutant accumulation during dry weather period and their washoff during a rainfall event. Results indicate mathematical shortcomings in the pollutant accumulation formulation used.",

    "abstract_s":"Place attachment is one’s strong emotional bond with a specific location. While there are numerous studies on the topic, the literature pays little attention to commercial settings. This is because they are seen as too insipid to rouse attachment. Consumer research, however, suggests otherwise. To address this disparity, the authors investigate how people develop, experience, and act on place attachment in commercial settings. Findings from consumer in-depth interviews and self-reports conducted in France reveal that place attachment develops through perceptions of familiarity, authenticity, and security and evolves into experiences of homeyness. Consumers find these encounters of homeyness extraordinary and respond by engaging in volunteering, over-reciprocation, and ambassadorship toward the place. The authors further theorize these findings through a gift economy perspective and identify a tripartite exchange between the consumer, the proprietor of the place, and selected people from the consumer’s social network.",

In-depth interviews were conducted to explore the reasons for consumers’ partial or total defection from mass retailing in Tunisia. Our results identify some unusual motives for rejection of imported hypermarkets due to (i) consumers’ non-adherence to the way these modern food stores put forward consumption as a spectacle resulting in voyeuristic behavior and social marking, and (ii) their religiously inspired culture and education that limits consumption and emphasizes the fairness, human and ethical dimensions of commerce. Our findings extend and enrich knowledge on consumer resistance by pointing out the amazing precocity of the emergence of this consumers’ opposition to the introduction of foreign retail formats, in an immature retail market, Tunisia for instance, that are deemed not to be congruent with local cultural and religious values.",

    "abstract_s":"Assessment of isotopic compositions at the base of food webs is a prerequisite for using stable isotope analysis to assess foraging locations and trophic positions of marine organisms. Our study represents a unique application of stable-isotope analyses across multiple trophic levels (primary producer, primary consumer and tertiary consumer) and over a large spatial scale in two pelagic marine ecosystems. We found that delta N-15 values of particulate organic matter (POM), barnacles and phenylalanine from the muscle tissue of yellowfin tuna all showed similar spatial patterns. This consistency suggests that isotopic analysis of any of these can provide a reasonable proxy for isotopic variability at the base of the food web. Secondly, variations in the delta N-15 values of yellowfin tuna bulk-muscle tissues paralleled the spatial trends observed in all of these isotopic baseline proxies. Variation in isotopic composition at the base of the food web, rather than differences in tuna diet, explained the 11 parts per thousand variability observed in the bulk-tissue delta N-15 values of yellowfin tuna. Evaluating the trophic position of yellowfin tuna using amino-acid isotopic compositions across the western Indian and equatorial Pacific Oceans strongly suggests these tuna occupy similar trophic positions, albeit absolute trophic positions estimated by this method were lower than expected. This study reinforces the importance of considering isotopic baseline variability for diet studies, and provides new insights into methods that can be applied to generate nitrogen isoscapes for worldwide comparisons of top predators in marine ecosystems",

    "title_s":"Enhanced Hough transforms for image processing",
    "abstract_s":"The thesis addresses the improvements of the Standard Hough Transform (SHT) for image processing applications. As a common tool for straight line segment detection, the Hough Transform (HT) has received extensive attention since its proposal in 1962. HT is robust since it converts the straight line detection problem to a peak seeking problem in the parameter space (also called HT space or Hough space). Feature points in the image space are mapped to the parameter space, according to the normal formulation of the possible straight lines crossing them. The cells in the digitalised parameter space obtain votes from the feature points. The local maxima, corresponding to peaks are built when corresponding cells obtain more votes than the ones around them. The peaks detected in the parameter space are then mapped back to the image space for validation. Unfortunately, when mapping feature points in the image space to the parameter space in conjunction with the voting process, rounding operations are employed, which leads to several problems of HT. The robustness, accuracy and resolution are all affected. This thesis aims to solve these problems, and the following contributions were made towards this goal : A) Because of the resolution limitation of SHT, the topics of how to select a “good” resolution, how to extend the resolutions of SHT and how to employ the super-resolution technique in HT are covered. In the research of these topics, several outputs are obtained, which are helpful to image processing applications. These include:- The map of HT performance versus resolutions is drawn, according to which “good” choices of resolutions can be found.- HT resolutions are extended by geometrical analysis of the HT butterflies.- Super resolution HT is proposed with consideration to the features of HT.- Self-similarity of the HT butterflies is discovered and employed to obtain high resolution HT with high reliability. B) For the accuracy defect of SHT, the error system of HT is studied when the image is shifted in the image space. The detection errors are employed to compensate for the defect, and an accurate HT is proposed. In order to evaluate existing HT varieties, an ideal HT is proposed as a standard",
